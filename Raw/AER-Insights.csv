Steady-State Social Distancing and Vaccination,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"This paper analyzes an economic-epidemiological model of infectious disease where it is possible to become infected more than once and individual agents make endogenous choices of social distancing and vaccine adoption. Protective actions adopted by any one person reduce future risks to other people. The positive externalities associated with these behaviors provide motivation for vaccine and social-distancing subsidies, but subsidizing one protective action reduces incentives for other protective actions. A vaccine subsidy increases vaccine adoption and reduces steady-state infection prevalence; a social distancing subsidy can either increase or reduce steady-state infection prevalence.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220699,Christopher Avery,Frederick Chen,David McAdams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D62,D91,I12,I18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Race and the Mismeasure of School Quality,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"In large urban districts, schools enrolling more White students tend to have higher performance ratings. We use an instrumental variables strategy leveraging centralized school assignment to explore this relationship. Estimates from Denver and New York City suggest that the correlation between school performance ratings and White enrollment shares reflects selection bias rather than causal school value added. In fact, value added in these two cities is essentially unrelated to White enrollment shares. A simple regression adjustment is shown to yield school ratings uncorrelated with race while predicting value added as well as or better than the corresponding unadjusted measures.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220292,Joshua Angrist,Peter Hull,Parag A.

Wage Garnishment in the United States: New Facts from Administrative Payroll Records,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"Wage garnishment allows creditors to deduct money from workers' paychecks to repay defaulted debts. We document new facts about wage garnishment between 2014 and 2019 using data from a large payroll processor that distributes paychecks to approximately 20 percent of US private-sector workers. By 2019, over 1 in every 100 workers was being garnished for delinquent debt. The average garnished worker experiences garnishment for five months, during which approximately 11 percent of gross earnings is remitted to their creditor(s). The beginning of a garnishment is associated with an increase in job turnover but no intensive margin change in hours worked.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220487,Anthony A.

The Irrelevance of Fee Structures for Certification,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"In models of certification, possible restrictions on the nature of the fee structures are commonly analyzed. We show that they are irrelevant for the certifier's ability to maximize profits and trade efficiency. Our results establish that certification schemes involve two substitutable dimensions—the fee structure and the disclosure rule. In the context of a canonical unit good certification setup, these dimensions act as perfect substitutes for achieving trade efficiency and (monotone) distributions of rents; adjustments in the disclosure dimension can fully mitigate restrictions in the fee dimension, but these changes do affect market transparency.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220698,Martin Pollrich,Roland Strausz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D82,D83,G24,G28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest Rates and the Spatial Polarization of Housing Markets,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, MARCH 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"Rising within-country differences in house values are a much-debated trend in the United States and internationally. Using new long-run regional data for 15 advanced economies, we show that standard explanations linking growing price dispersion to rent dispersion are contradicted by an important stylized fact: rent dispersion has increased far less than price dispersion. We propose a new explanation: a uniform decline in real risk-free interest rates can have heterogeneous spatial effects on house values. Falling real safe rates disproportionately push up prices in large agglomerations where initial rent-price ratios are low, leading to housing market polarization on the national level.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220367,Francisco Amaral,Martin Dohmen,Sebastian Kohl,Moritz Schularick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E43,R21,R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ghosting the Tax Authority: Fake Firms and Tax Fraud in Ecuador,"VOL. 5, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"An important but poorly understood form of firm tax evasion arises from ""ghost firms""—fake firms that issue fraudulent receipts so that their clients can claim false deductions. We provide a unique window into this global phenomenon using transaction-level tax data from Ecuador. Five percent of firms use ghost invoices annually. Among these firms, ghost transactions comprise 14 percent of purchases. Ghost transactions are prevalent among large firms and firms with high-income owners and exhibit suspicious patterns, such as bunching below financial system thresholds.

Should We Tax Capital Income or Wealth?,"VOL. 5, NO. 2, JUNE 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We study optimal capital income and wealth taxation in an economy that reproduces the importance of private businesses for output and inequality. If entrepreneurs are subject to collateral constraints, they face heterogeneous rates of return, which generate a meaningful distinction between capital income and wealth taxation. We find that taxing capital income is preferable to taxing wealth because the efficiency gains from wealth taxation are swamped by the redistributional benefits of taxing the profits of richer entrepreneurs. Consequently, the gains from taxing wealth are modest.

Influence Motives in Social Signaling: Evidence from COVID-19 Vaccinations in Germany,"VOL. 5, NO. 2, JUNE 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We investigate whether a desire to influence others' choices affects our own behavior. To separate such influence motives from social pressure, we study participants' willingness to register for a COVID-19 vaccination in a field experiment in Germany. We vary whether participants' registration decisions are shared with a peer, to activate social pressure, and whether peers are informed before their own decision, to isolate influence motives. We find that influence motives double participants' registration likelihood, an effect driven by individuals with ex ante trust in the vaccine. Despite anticipating to influence their peers, participants cannot alter peer behavior in the experiment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20220163,Emilio Esguerra,Leonhard Vollmer,Johannes Wimmer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C93,D12,D82,D91,I12,I18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Environmental Preferences and Technological Choices: Is Market Competition Clean or Dirty?,"VOL. 5, NO. 1, MARCH 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We investigate the effects of consumers' environmental concerns and market competition on firms' decisions to innovate in ""clean"" technologies. Agents care about their consumption and environmental footprint; firms pursue greener products to soften price competition. Acting as complements, these forces determine R&D, pollution, and welfare. We test the theory using panel data on patents by 7,060 automobile sector firms in 25 countries, environmental willingness to pay, and competition. As predicted, exposure to prosocial attitudes fosters clean innovation, all the more so where competition is strong.

Patents receive 26 percent fewer citations from within a radius of 20 miles around the deceased, relative to still-living coinventors.

In reduced form, the model dynamics are similar to that in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009), with their habit parameter replaced by our probability of wage-contract resetting.

Understanding the Ownership Structure of Corporate Bonds,"VOL. 5, NO. 1, MARCH 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"Insurers are the largest institutional investors of corporate bonds. However, a standard theory of insurance markets, in which insurers maximize firm value subject to regulatory or risk constraints, predicts no allocation to corporate bonds. We resolve this puzzle in an equilibrium asset pricing model with leverage-constrained households and institutional investors. Insurers have relatively cheap access to leverage through their underwriting activity. They hold a leveraged portfolio of low-beta assets in equilibrium, relaxing other investors' leverage constraints.

Risk Exposure and Acquisition of Macroeconomic Information,"VOL. 4, NO. 1, MARCH 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We conduct an experiment with a representative sample from the United States to study households' demand for macroeconomic information. Respondents who learn of a higher personal exposure to unemployment risk during recessions increase their demand for an expert forecast about the likelihood of a recession. This finding is consistent with macroeconomic models of endogenous information acquisition, according to which the demand for information depends on its expected benefits. Moreover, respondents' updating about their personal unemployment risk suggests that households are imperfectly informed about their exposure to aggregate fluctuations, which may distort their beliefs about the benefits of acquiring macroeconomic information.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200662,Christopher Roth,Sonja Settele,Johannes Wohlfart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D12,D83,E24,E32,G01,J64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reducing the real interest rate one year from now increases output by only 41 percent as much as reducing the real interest rate today. The power of forward guidance declines further at longer horizons.

For most longer-run outcomes, using both SED and test score value added more than doubles the variance of the explained school effect relative to using test score value added alone.

Evidence from International Trade,"VOL. 2, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"Are financial crises a negative shock to aggregate demand or supply? This is a fundamental question for research and policy making. Arguments for stimulus usually presume demand-side shortfalls; arguments for tax cuts or structural reform look to the supply side. Resolving the question requires models with both mechanisms, and empirical tests to tell them apart. We develop a small open economy model, where a country is subject to deleveraging shocks that impose binding credit constraints on households and/or firms. These financial crisis events leave distinct statistical signatures in the time series record that divide sharply between each type of shock. Empirical analysis reveals a clear picture: after financial crises the dominant pattern is that imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real exchange rate depreciates.

The first reform, implemented in 2002, lowered benefits for non-EU immigrants by about 50 percent, with no changes for natives or EU immigrants. The policy was later repealed and reintroduced. Based on a quasi-experimental research design, we find sizable effects: the benefit reduction reduced the net flow of immigrants by about 5,000 people per year, and the subsequent repeal of the policy reversed the effect almost exactly. The implied elasticity of migration with respect to benefits equals 1.3.

"Jobs and Matches: Quits, Replacement Hiring, and Vacancy Chains","VOL. 2, NO. 1, MARCH 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"In the canonical DMP model of job openings, all job openings stem from new job creation. Jobs denote worker-firm matches, which are destroyed following worker quits. Yet, employers classify 56 percent of vacancies as quit-driven replacement hiring into old jobs, which evidently outlived their previous matches. Accordingly, aggregate and firm-level hiring tightly track quits. We augment the DMP model with longer-lived jobs arising from sunk job creation costs and replacement hiring. Quits trigger vacancies, which beget vacancies through replacement hiring. This vacancy chain can raise total job openings and net employment. The procyclicality of quits can thereby amplify business cycles.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190023,Yusuf Mercan,Benjamin Schoefer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,E32,J23,J31,J63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do Immigrants Assimilate More Slowly Today Than in the Past?,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, MARCH 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"Using millions of historical census records and modern birth certificates, we document that immigrants assimilated into US society at similar rates in the past and present. We measure cultural assimilation as immigrants giving their children less foreign names after spending more time in the United States, and show that immigrants erase about one-half of the naming gap with natives after 20 years both historically and today. Immigrants from poorer countries choose more foreign names upon first arrival in both periods but are among the fastest to shift toward native-sounding names.

Discriminating against Captive Customers,"VOL. 1, NO. 3, DECEMBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We analyze a market where some consumers only consider buying from a specific seller while other consumers choose the best deal from several sellers. When sellers are able to discriminate against their captive customers, we show that discrimination harms consumers in aggregate relative to the situation with uniform pricing when sellers are approximately symmetric, while the practice tends to benefit consumers in sufficiently asymmetric markets. We also show how the asymmetry of markets may be affected by the information that firms have on consumer captivity.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180581,Mark Armstrong,John Vickers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D11,D43,D83,L13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reported Effects versus Revealed-Preference Estimates: Evidence from the Propensity to Spend Tax Rebates,"VOL. 1, NO. 3, DECEMBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We evaluate the consistency of two methods for estimating the effect of an economic policy: (i) asking people how the policy caused them to change their behavior (reported effects) and (ii) inferring this change using data on behavior and differences in treatment across people (revealed-preference estimates). Both methods are widely used to measure spending caused by increases in liquidity. Using federal stimulus payments disbursed quasi-randomly in 2008, we find larger revealed-preference estimates of spending propensities for households who report greater spending responses, and the methods produce similar average propensities.

In contrast with Angrist and Lavy (1999), newer estimates show no evidence of class size effects. The new data also reveal enrollment manipulation near Maimonides cutoffs. A modified rule that uses birthdays to impute enrollment circumvents manipulation while still generating precisely estimated zeros. In both old and new data, Maimonides' rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics conditional on a few controls. Enrollment manipulation therefore appears to be innocuous.

But these analyses overlook the fact that female entrepreneurs often reside with male entrepreneurs. Using data from experiments in India, Sri Lanka, and Ghana, we show that the observed gender gap in microenterprise responses does not reflect lower returns on investment, when measured at the household level. Instead, the absence of a profit response among female-run enterprises reflects the fact that women's capital is typically invested into their husband's enterprise.

When Work Disappears: Manufacturing Decline and the Falling Marriage Market Value of Young Men,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, SEPTEMBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW: INSIGHTS,"We exploit the gender-specific components of large-scale labor demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition to test how shifts in the relative economic stature of young men versus young women affected marriage, fertility, and children's living circumstances during 1990–2014. On average, trade shocks differentially reduce employment and earnings of young adult males. Consistent with Becker's model of household specialization, shocks to males' relative earnings reduce marriage and fertility. Consistent with prominent sociological accounts, these shocks heighten male idleness and premature mortality, and raise the share of mothers who are unwed and the share of children living in below-poverty, single-headed households.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20180010,David Autor,David Dorn,Gordon Hanson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F16,J12,J13,J23,J31,L60,J16,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under perfect competition, the result follows from the separability of consumption and production across countries, ruling out tourism and some forms of multinational firms, but not others. Though we do not require trade balance, the role of initial assets is subtle: our result rules out foreign ownership of domestic assets, but does not constrain domestic ownership of foreign assets.
