"Local Retail Prices, Product Variety, and Neighborhood Change","VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"We study how local grocery markets within a city are affected by changes in housing markets. Our empirical strategy exploits a shift in the spatial distribution of construction activity induced by a large-scale, place-based tax exemption in the city of Montevideo. The introduction of new housing stock induced by the policy causes a reduction in grocery prices of 2.3 percent and an increase in locally available product varieties. Using insights from a multiproduct model of imperfect competition and estimates for different types of stores, we show these changes are the result of incumbents' response to an increase in local demand.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20210817,Fernando Borraz,Felipe Carozzi,Nicolás González- Pampillón,Leandro Zipitría,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,L81,O18,R22,R23,R31,R38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Behavioral Responses to State Income Taxation of High Earners: Evidence from California,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Using administrative data, we analyze the response to Proposition 30, a 2012 measure that increased California marginal tax rates by up to 3 percentage points for high-income households. Relative to baseline departure rates, an additional 0.8 percent of the residential tax base that landed in the top bracket left California in 2013. Using matched out-of-state taxpayers as controls reveals an income elasticity with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate of 2.5–3.2 for high earners who stayed. These responses eroded 45.2 percent of state windfall tax revenues within the first year and 60.9 percent within 2 years, driven largely by the intensive margin.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20200500,Joshua Rauh,Ryan Shyu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D91,H24,H31,H71,H73,J61,R23,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hassle Costs versus Information: How Do Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Reduce Opioid Prescribing?,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"We study hassle costs versus information provision in explaining how prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) decrease opioid prescribing. PDMPs aim to reduce opioid prescribing through information provision but may also unintentionally affect prescribing through the hassle of required record checks. We analyze Kentucky's landmark PDMP to disentangle these two mechanisms. Hassle costs reduce opioid prescribing across the board, including to opioid-naive patients; however, physicians continue to prescribe opioids to patients who would benefit the most. Although information also affects prescribing, hassle costs explain the majority of the decline.

Labor Supply Responses to Income Taxation among Older Couples: Evidence from a Canadian Reform,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"I assess whether the tax code is a viable policy lever for influencing labor supply among older workers. Specifically, using administrative data from Canada, I estimate the earnings responses to a unique reform that lowered tax burdens for couples with a pensioner, using quasi-experimental methods. I find that workers decrease labor supply as tax bills decline but do not respond to changes in marginal tax rates.

The significance of this externality hinges on the accuracy of employers' beliefs and the responsiveness of human capital.

Exploring Residual Profit Allocation,"VOL. 15, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Residual profit allocation (RPA) schemes have come to prominence in discussions of international tax reform but with almost nothing known about their economic impact. These schemes tax multinationals by allocating their ""routine"" profits to source countries and sharing their remaining ""residual"" profit across countries on some formulaic basis. This paper explores the implications, conceptual and empirical, of moving to some form of RPA. Residual profits are estimated to be substantial and concentrated in relatively few multinational enterprises. The impact on tax revenue appears beneficial for developing countries.

Tax Audits as Scarecrows: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment,"VOL. 15, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"The canonical model of Allingham and Sandmo (1972) predicts that firms evade taxes by optimally trading off between the costs and benefits of evasion.

We sent letters to 20,440 small- and medium-sized firms that collectively paid more than US$200 million in taxes per year.

While small-scale experiments change behaviors among adults in the short run, we know little about the effectiveness of large-scale policies or the longer-run impacts. To nudge primary school children into a long-term habit of exercising, the German state of Saxony distributed sports club membership vouchers among all 33,000 third graders in 2009. In 2018, we carried out a register-based survey to evaluate the policy. Even after a decade, awareness of the voucher program was significantly higher in the treatment group. We also find that youth received and redeemed the vouchers.

Results show that SISU changes enrollment decisions of high-SES students, crowding out low-SES groups from the least competitive degrees disproportionately.

Counterfactual analysis shows that local protection leads to significant consumer choice distortions and results in 21.9 billion yuan of consumer welfare loss, amounting to 41 percent of total subsidy.

Informal Labor and the Efficiency Cost of Social Programs: Evidence from Unemployment Insurance in Brazil,"VOL. 13, NO. 3, AUGUST 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"It is widely believed that the presence of a large informal sector increases the efficiency cost of social programs in developing countries. We evaluate such claims for the case of unemployment insurance (UI) by combining an optimal UI framework with comprehensive data from Brazil. Using quasi-experimental variation in potential UI duration, we find clear evidence for the usual moral hazard problem that UI reduces incentives to return to a formal job. Yet, the associated efficiency cost is lower than it is in the United States, and it is lower in labor markets with higher informality within Brazil. This is because formal reemployment rates are lower to begin with where informality is higher, so that a larger share of workers would draw UI benefits absent any moral hazard.

Retail Prices in a City,"VOL. 13, NO. 2, MAY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This study examines grocery price differentials across neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area (the city of Jerusalem, Israel). Important variation in access to affordable grocery shopping is documented using CPI data on prices and neighborhood-level credit card expenditure data. Residents of peripheral, nonaffluent neighborhoods are charged some of the highest prices in the city and yet display a low tendency to shop outside their neighborhood. In contrast, residents of affluent, centrally located neighborhoods often benefit from lower grocery prices charged in their own neighborhood while also displaying a high propensity to shop at the hard discount grocers located in the city's commercial districts. The role of spatial frictions in shaping these patterns is studied within a structural model where households determine their shopping destination and retailers choose prices. The estimated model implies strong spatial segmentation in households' demand. Counterfactual analyses reveal that alleviating spatial frictions results in considerable benefits to the average resident of the peripheral neighborhoods. At the same time, it barely affects the equilibrium prices charged across the city, and so it does little to benefit households with limited mobility (e.g., the elderly).",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180218,Alon Eizenberg,Saul Lach,Merav Oren-Yiftach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,L11,L81,R22,R23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, we show that this stalled educational progress was particularly pronounced in states that experienced larger recessionary budget cuts for plausibly exogenous reasons. To isolate budget cuts that were unrelated to (i) other ill-effects of the recession or (ii) endogenous state policies, we use states' historical reliance on state-appropriated funds (which are more sensitive to the business cycle) to fund public schools interacted with the timing of the recession as instruments for reductions in school spending.

Relaxation of down payment constraints or an exogenous increase in nonhousing wealth has large effects on WTP, especially for poorer and more credit-constrained households. However, changing the mortgage rate has only moderate effects on WTP. These findings have implications for theoretical models of house price determination and for policy.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150337,Andreas Fuster,Basit Zafar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,G21,G51,R21,R38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data,"VOL. 13, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"To finance unemployment insurance, states raise payroll tax rates on employers who engage in layoffs. Tax rates are, therefore, highest for firms after downturns, potentially hampering labor-market recovery. Using full-population, administrative records from Florida, I estimate the effect of these tax increases on firm behavior leveraging a regression kink design in the tax schedule. Tax hikes reduce hiring and employment substantially, with no effect on layoffs or wages. The results imply unanticipated costs of the financing regime which reduce the optimal benefit by a quarter and account for 12 percent of the unemployment in the wake of the Great Recession.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20190031,Andrew C.

The Long-Run Effects of a Public Policy on Alcohol Tastes and Mortality,"VOL. 13, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"We study the long-run effects of Russia's anti-alcohol campaign, which dramatically altered the relative supply of hard and light alcohol in the late 1980s. We find that this policy shifted young men's long-run preferences from hard to light alcohol decades later, and we estimate the age at which consumers form their tastes. We show that the large beer market expansion in the late 1990s had similar effects on young consumers' tastes, while older consumers' tastes remained largely unchanged. We then link these long-run changes in alcohol consumption patterns to changes in male mortality. The shift from hard to light alcohol reduced incidences of binge drinking substantially, leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths. We conclude that the resulting large cohort differences in current alcohol consumption shares explain a significant part of the recent decrease in male mortality. Simulations suggest that mortality will continue to decrease by another 23 percent over the next 20 years due to persistent changes in consumer tastes. Program impact evaluations that focus only on contemporaneous effects can therefore severely underestimate the total effect of such public policies that change preferences for goods.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180439,Lorenz Kueng,Evgeny Yakovlev,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D12,H25,H31,I12,I18,L66,P36,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using county-level variation in the timing and magnitude of sanctions linked to student loan default rates, we estimate that sanctioned for-profits experience a 68 percent decrease in annual enrollment following sanction receipt. Enrollment losses due to for-profit sanctions are 60–70 percent offset by increased enrollment within local community colleges, where students are less likely to default on federal student loans. Conversely, for-profit sanctions decrease enrollment in local unsanctioned for-profit competitors, likely due to improved information about local options and reputational spillovers. Overall, market enrollment declines by 2 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180265,Stephanie R. Cellini,Rajeev Darolia,Lesley J.

Revisiting the Effects of Unemployment Insurance Extensions on Unemployment: A Measurement-Error-Corrected Regression Discontinuity Approach,"VOL. 12, NO. 2, MAY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This study documents two potential biases in recent analyses of UI benefit extensions using boundary-based identification: bias from using county-level aggregates and bias from across-border policy spillovers. To examine the first bias, the analysis uses a regression discontinuity approach that accounts for measurement error in county-level aggregates. These results suggest much smaller effects than previous studies, casting doubt on the applicability of border-based designs. The analysis then shows substantial spillover effects of UI benefit duration on across-border work patterns, consistent with increased tightness in high-benefit states and providing evidence against a dominant vacancy reduction response to UI extensions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160439,Steven Dieterle,Otávio Bartalotti,Quentin Brummet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,E32,J22,J64,J65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances indicates widespread saving in anticipation of major expenditures like home purchases and college education.

The educational program was randomly assigned among high school students, and choices were measured using an incentivized experiment. Students who participated in the program make more time-consistent choices; are more likely to allocate payments to a single payment date, as opposed to spreading payment across two dates; and display increased consistency of choice with the law of demand.

Projections and Uncertainties about Climate Change in an Era of Minimal Climate Policies,"VOL. 10, NO. 3, AUGUST 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Climate change remains one of the major international environmental challenges facing nations. Up to now, nations have adopted minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to develop new projections of trends and impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results with those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if major climate-change policies are not taken. It suggests that it is unlikely that nations can achieve the 2°C target of international agreements, even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term.

These effects are driven by a behavioral change among these policemen. We find no evidence of favoritism within the police.

Selection and Market Reallocation: Productivity Gains from Multinational Production,"VOL. 10, NO. 2, MAY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Assessing productivity gains from multinational production has been a vital topic of economic research and policy debate. Positive productivity gains are often attributed to productivity spillovers; however, an alternative, much less emphasized channel is selection and market reallocation, whereby competition leads to factor and revenue reallocation within and between domestic firms and exits of the least productive firms. We investigate the roles of these different mechanisms in determining aggregate-productivity gains using a unifying framework that explores the mechanisms' distinct predictions on the distributions of domestic firms: within-firm productivity improvement shifts rightward or reshapes the productivity distribution, while selection and market reallocation move the revenue and employment distributions leftward and raise left truncations. Using a rich cross-country firm-level panel dataset, we find significant evidence of both mechanisms and effects of competition in product, technology, and labor space. However, selection and market reallocation account for the majority of aggregate-productivity gains, suggesting ignoring this channel could lead to substantial bias in understanding the nature of productivity gains from multinational production.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150437,Laura Alfaro,Maggie X.

Areas in the United States with declining labor demand and incomes due to increasing import competition from China experience relative declines in housing prices and business activity. Since local governments are disproportionately funded through property and sales taxation, declining property values and a decrease in economic activity translate into less revenue, which constrains the ability of local governments to provide public services. State and federal governments have limited ability to smooth local shocks, and the impact on the provision of public services is compounded when local income shocks are highly correlated with shocks in the rest of the state.

Consumers' Response to State Energy Efficient Appliance Rebate Programs,"VOL. 9, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Through an evaluation of the 2009 Recovery Act's State Energy Efficient Appliance Rebate Program, this paper examines consumers' response to energy efficiency rebates. The analysis shows that 70 percent of consumers claiming a rebate were inframarginal and an additional 15 percent-20 percent of consumers simply delayed their purchases by a few weeks. Consumers responded to rebates by upgrading to higher quality, but less energy-efficient models. Overall the impact of the program on long-term energy demand is likely to be small.

Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments,"VOL. 9, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Governments may extract rent from private citizens by inflating taxes and spending on projects benefiting special interests. Using a spatial equilibrium model, I show that less elastic housing supplies increase governments' abilities to extract rents. Inelastic housing supply, driven by exogenous variation in local topography, raises local governments' tax revenues and causes citizens to combat rent seeking by enacting laws limiting the power of elected officials.

Capacity and Utilization in Health Care: The Effect of Empty Beds on Neonatal Intensive Care Admission,"VOL. 8, NO. 2, MAY 2016",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Because geographic variation in medical care utilization is jointly determined by both supply and demand, it is difficult to empirically estimate whether capacity itself has a causal impact on utilization in health care. In this paper, I exploit short-term variation in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) capacity that is unlikely to be correlated with unobserved demand determinants. I find that available NICU beds have little to no effect on NICU utilization for the sickest infants, but do increase utilization for those in the range of birth weights where admission decisions are likely to be more discretionary.

General Equilibrium Impacts of a Federal Clean Energy Standard,"VOL. 8, NO. 2, MAY 2016",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Economists have tended to view emissions pricing (e.g., cap and trade or a carbon tax) as the most cost-effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This paper offers a different view. Employing analytical and numerically solved general equilibrium models, it provides plausible conditions under which a more conventional form of regulation—namely, the use of a clean energy standard (CES)—is more cost-effective. The models reveal that the CES distorts factor markets less because it is a smaller implicit tax on factors of production. This advantage more than offsets the disadvantages of the CES when minor emissions reductions are involved. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20140011,Lawrence H. Goulder,Marc A. C.

Our quasi-experimental analysis examines the introduction of a major financial incentive to choose limited network plans that affected a subset of GIC enrollees. We find that enrollees are very price sensitive in their decision to enroll in limited network plans. Those who switched spent almost 40 percent less on medical care. This reflects reductions in the quantity of services and prices paid per service. The spending reductions came from specialist and hospital care, while spending on primary care rose.

Moving tax collection upstream from retailers substantially raises the pass-through of diesel taxes to consumers. Furthermore, tax revenues increase when collecting taxes from wholesalers rather than from retailers, suggesting that evasion is the likely explanation for the incidence result.

US State Fiscal Policy and Natural Resources,"VOL. 7, NO. 3, AUGUST 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"An analytical framework predicts that, in response to an exogenous increase in resource-based government revenue, a benevolent government will partially substitute away from taxing income, increase spending and save. Fifty-one years of US-state level data are largely consistent with this theory. A baseline fixed effects model predicts that a $1.00 increase in resource revenue results in a $0.25 decrease in nonresource revenue, a $0.43 increase in spending and a $0.32 increase in savings. Instrumenting for resource revenue reveals that a positive revenue shock is largely saved and the rest is transferred back to residents in the form of lower non resource tax rates.

New Evidence on Taxes and the Timing of Birth,"VOL. 7, NO. 2, MAY 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This paper uses data from the universe of tax returns filed between 2001 and 2010 to test whether parents shift the timing of childbirth around the New Year to gain tax benefits. Filers have an incentive to shift births from early January into late December, through induction or cesarean delivery, because child-related tax benefits are not prorated. We find evidence of a positive, but very small, effect of tax incentives on birth timing. An additional $1,000 of tax benefits increases the probability of a late-December birth by only about 1 percentage point. We argue that the response to tax incentives is small in part because of confusion about eligibility and delays in the issuance of Social Security numbers for newborns, as well as a lack of control over medical procedures on the part of filers with the highest tax values. In contrast to this small behavioral response, we do document a substantial reporting response among self-employed parents facing changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit as a result of a child's birth.

By using state administrative data we include institutions that do not participate in federal student aid programs and are missed in official counts. Including these institutions doubles the number of for-profits and increases students by one-third compared with official counts. Aid-eligible institutions charge tuition for sub-baccalaureate (mainly certificate) programs that is about 78 percent higher than that charged by comparable programs in nonparticipating institutions, lending some credence to the ""Bennett hypothesis"" of federal aid capture.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.6.4.174,Stephanie Riegg Cellini,Claudia Goldin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H52,I22,I23,I28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cash for Coolers: Evaluating a Large-Scale Appliance Replacement Program in Mexico,"VOL. 6, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2014",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This paper evaluates a large-scale appliance replacement program in Mexico that from 2009 to 2012 helped 1.9 million households replace their old refrigerators and air conditioners with energyefficient models. Using household-level billing records from the universe of Mexican residential customers, we find that refrigerator replacement reduces electricity consumption by 8 percent, about one-quarter of what was predicted by ex ante analyses. Moreover, we find that air conditioning replacement actually increases electricity consumption.

Can Owning a Home Hedge the Risk of Moving?,"VOL. 5, NO. 2, MAY 2013",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"For households that face a possibility of moving across MSAs, the risk of home owning depends on the covariance of the sale prices of their current houses with the purchase prices of their likely future houses. We find empirically that households tend to move between highly correlated MSAs, significantly increasing the distribution of expected correlations in real house price growth across MSAs, and so raising the ""moving-hedge"" value of owning. Own/rent decisions are sensitive to this hedging value, with households being more likely to own when their hedging value is greater due to higher expected correlations and likelihoods of moving.

A Model-Based Evaluation of the Debate on the Size of the Tax Multiplier,"VOL. 4, NO. 2, MAY 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"The SVAR and narrative approaches to estimating tax multipliers deliver significantly different results. The former yields multipliers of about 1 and the latter of about 3. The two approaches differ along two important dimensions: the identification scheme and the reduced-form transmission mechanism. This paper uses a DSGE-model to evaluate the hypothesis that the difference in multipliers is due to differences in transmission mechanisms. The main finding of the paper is that this hypothesis is rejected. Instead, the observed differences in estimated multipliers are due either to the models failing to identify the same tax shock, or to small-sample uncertainty.

Fiscal Policy Multipliers on Subnational Government Spending,"VOL. 4, NO. 2, MAY 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Balanced budget requirements lead to substantial pro-cyclicality in state government spending, with the stringency of a state's rules driving the pace at which it must adjust to shocks. We show that fiscal institutions can generate natural experiments in deficit-financed spending that are informative regarding fiscal stabilization policy. Alternative sources of variation in subnational fiscal policy often implicitly involve ""windfall"" financing, which precludes any effect of future debt or taxation on current consumption and investment. Consistent with a role for these ""Ricardian"" effects, our estimates are smaller than those in related studies, implying an on-impact multiplier below 1.

Measuring Tax Multipliers: The Narrative Method in Fiscal VARs,"VOL. 4, NO. 2, MAY 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This paper argues in favor of empirical models built by including in fiscal VAR models structural shocks identified via the narrative method. We first show that ""narrative"" shocks are orthogonal to the relevant information set a fiscal VAR. We then derive impulse responses to these shocks. The use of narrative shocks does not require the inversion of the moving-average representation of a VAR for the identification of the relevant shocks. Therefore, within this framework, fiscal multipliers can be identified and estimated even when, in the presence of ""fiscal foresight,"" the MA representation of the VARs is not invertible.

This paper proposes a simple methodology that empirically identifies the separate effects of entry and size restrictions on aggregate productivity, and uses it to analyse the impact of a policy reform in India.

No Child Left Behind: Subsidized Child Care and Children's Long-Run Outcomes,"VOL. 3, NO. 2, MAY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Many developed countries are currently considering a move toward subsidized, widely accessible child care or preschool. However, studies on how large-scale provision of child care affects child development are scarce, and focused on short-run outcomes. We analyze a large-scale expansion of subsidized child care in Norway, addressing the impact on children's long-run outcomes. Our precise and robust difference-in-differences estimates show that subsidized child care had strong positive effects on children's educational attainment and labor market participation, and also reduced welfare dependency. Subsample analyses indicate that girls and children with low-educated mothers benefit the most from child care.

The End of Court-Ordered Desegregation,"VOL. 3, NO. 2, MAY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"In response to three Supreme Court rulings in the early 1990s, numerous court-ordered desegregation plans have been terminated. Using a unique dataset and an event study research design, this paper explores the impact of these terminations.

Outside of the south, dismissal also increases the rate at which black students drop out of school and attend private school. In the south, in contrast, there is no change in the school attendance patterns of blacks. Finally, evidence is presented that whites re-enter dismissed districts in large numbers in the south.

In contrast, corporate taxes do not distort the manager's payout decision and may only create second-order efficiency costs.

However, in the third intervention, youth volunteered to teach camps, and children who attended substantially improved their reading skills. This suggests that citizens face constraints in influencing public services. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.2.1.1,Abhijit V.

Tagging and Income Taxation: Theory and an Application,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"We derive a set of analytical results for optimal income taxation with tags using quasilinear preferences and a Rawlsian social welfare function. Secondly, assuming a constant elasticity of labor supply and log-normality of the skills distribution, we analytically identify the winners and losers of tagging. Third, we prove that if the skills distribution in one group first-order stochastically dominates the other, tagging calls for redistribution from the former to the latter group. Finally, we calibrate our model to the US workers using gender as tag. Welfare implications are dramatic. Only male high-wage earners lose. Everyone else gains, some substantially.

Input Constraints and the Efficiency of Entry: Lessons from Cardiac Surgery,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Prior studies suggest that with elastically supplied inputs free entry may lead to an inefficiently high number of firms in equilibrium. Under input scarcity, however, the welfare loss from free entry is reduced. Further, free entry may increase use of high-quality inputs, as oligopolistic firms underuse these inputs when entry is constrained. We assess these predictions by examining how the 1996 repeal of certificate-of-need (CON ) legislation in Pennsylvania affected the market for cardiac surgery in the state. We show that entry led to a redistribution of surgeries to higher quality surgeons, and that this entry was approximately welfare neutral.

Tax Competition for Heterogeneous Firms with Endogenous Entry,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This paper models tax competition for mobile firms that are differentiated by their productivities. Because taxes affect the distribution of firms, they affect wages, prices, and the number of firms. From the social planner's perspective, optimal taxes efficiently distribute income between private and public consumption and are harmonized, providing the optimal number of firms. This is not a Nash equilibrium. As is common in such models, equilibrium taxes are inefficiently low. Furthermore, there is no pure strategy equilibrium with equal taxes resulting in too many firms. This illustrates a new distortion from tax competition and a new benefit from harmonization. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.2.1.77,Ronald B.

Time Is Money: Choosing between Charitable Activities,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"This paper analyzes the impact of a preferential tax-price for monetary donations on the joint decision to donate time (volunteer) and money. The methodological approach takes into account that consumption of each charitable good affects consumption of the other. Using data from a national survey on household charitable giving, the results show that donations of time and money are substitutes. However, a decrease in the tax-price of monetary donations also has a positive effect on donations of time that acts outside the change in relative prices. This more than offsets the substitution effect leading to an overall positive correlation between the two charitable goods. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.2.1.103,Naomi E.

Using data on cigarette tax rates, taxable cigarette sales and individual smoking rates by state from 1980 to 2005 merged with data on Internet penetration, this paper documents that there has been a substantial increase in the sensitivity of taxable cigarette sales to state tax rates that is correlated with the rise of Internet usage within states. The estimates imply that the increased sensitivity from cigarette smuggling over the Internet has lessened the revenue generating potential of cigarette tax increases significantly, although states are still far from the revenue-maximizing tax rates.

The Optimal Taxation of Height: A Case Study of Utilitarian Income Redistribution,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Should the income tax include a credit for short taxpayers and a surcharge for tall ones? The standard utilitarian framework for tax analysis answers this question in the affirmative. Moreover, a plausible parameterization using data on height and wages implies a substantial height tax: a tall person earning $50,000 should pay $4,500 more in tax than a short person. One interpretation is that personal attributes correlated with wages should be considered more widely for determining taxes. Alternatively, if policies such as a height tax are rejected, then the standard utilitarian framework must fail to capture intuitive notions of distributive justice.

But EITC-induced increases in labor supply may drive wages down. I simulate the economic incidence of the EITC. In each scenario that I consider, a large portion of low-income single mothers' EITC payments is captured by employers through reduced wages. Workers who are EITC ineligible also see wage declines. By contrast, a traditional Negative Income Tax (NIT) discourages work, and so induces large transfers from employers to their workers. With my preferred parameters, $1 in EITC spending increases after-tax incomes by $0.73, while $1 spent on the NIT yields $1.39.

Is the Taxable Income Elasticity Sufficient to Calculate Deadweight Loss? The Implications of Evasion and Avoidance,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"Martin Feldstein's (1999) widely used taxable income formula for deadweight loss assumes the marginal social cost of evasion and avoidance equals the tax rate. This condition is likely to be violated in practice for two reasons. First, some of the costs of evasion and avoidance are transfers to other agents. Second, some individuals overestimate the costs of evasion and avoidance. In such situations, excess burden depends on a weighted average of the taxable income and total earned income elasticities, with the weight determined by the resource cost of sheltering income from taxation. This generalized formula implies the efficiency cost of taxing high income individuals is not necessarily large despite evidence that their reported incomes are highly sensitive to marginal tax rates.

Policy simulations suggest that a 10 percent increase in gasoline prices from 2005 levels will generate a 0.22 percent increase in fleet fuel economy in the short run and a 2.04 percent increase in the long run.

Optimal Tax Design and Enforcement with an Informal Sector,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY,"An optimal commodity tax approach is taken to compare trade taxes and VATs when some commodities are produced informally. Trade taxes apply to all imports and exports, including intermediate goods, while the VAT applies only to sales by the formal sector and imports. The VAT achieves production efficiency within the formal sector, but, unlike trade taxes, cannot indirectly tax profits. Making the size of the informal sector endogenous in each regime is potentially decisive. The ability of the government to change the size of the informal sector through costly enforcement may also tip the balance in favor of the VAT.

The key implication is that squatters ""squeeze"" the formal market, raising the price paid by formal residents. The squatter organizer ensures that squeezing is not too severe, since otherwise, the formal price will rise to a level that invites eviction by landowners. Because eviction is absent in equilibrium, the model differs from previous analytical frameworks, where eviction occurs with some probability. It also facilitates a general equilibrium analysis of squatter formalization policies. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.28,Jan K.
