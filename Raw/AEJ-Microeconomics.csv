Predicting Cooperation with Learning Models,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We use simulations of a simple learning model to predict cooperation rates in the experimental play of the indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. We suppose that learning and the game parameters only influence play in the initial round of each supergame, and that after these rounds, play depends only on the outcome of the previous round. We find that our model predicts out-of-sample cooperation at least as well as models with more parameters and harder-to-interpret machine learning algorithms. Our results let us predict the effect of session length and help explain past findings on the role of strategic uncertainty.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20220148,Drew Fudenberg,Gustav Karreskog Rehbinder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C57,C72,C73,D83,D91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Connectedness and Information Markets,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper investigates information quality in a simple model of socially connected information markets. Suppliers' payoffs derive from the fraction of consumers who see their stories. Consumers prefer to share and act only on high-quality information. Quality is endogenous and highest when social connectedness is neither too high nor too low. In highly connected markets, low-quality stories are widely seen, giving suppliers little incentive to invest in quality. Increasing the volume of misinformation and increasing consumers' costs of tuning in to suppliers' broadcasts can each increase equilibrium information quality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20220056,Rachel Kranton,David McAdams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D11,D82,D83,L82,Z13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Innovation in Decentralized Markets: Technology versus Synthetic Products,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Advances in market-clearing technology for multiple assets and synthetic products present alternative ways to leverage complementarities and substitutabilities in asset payoffs. This paper compares their equilibrium and welfare effects. In competitive markets, either instrument can mimic the efficient design. When traders have price impact, however, synthetic products and market-clearing technology provide separate instruments for impacting markets' performance and can generate synergies or trade-offs. Neither instrument can generally reproduce the other's payoffs state by state. Moreover, innovation in market clearing renders additional synthetic products nonredundant. Our analysis points to the advantages of each type of innovation while also exposing potential risks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20220138,Marzena Rostek,Ji Hee Yoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D44,D47,G11,G12,G13,O31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exit Dilemma: The Role of Private Learning on Firm Survival,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We study the exit of duopolists from a stochastically declining market. Firms privately learn about the market conditions from observing the stochastic arrival of customers, while exit decisions are publicly observed. A larger firm is more likely to have customers and hence has better information about the market conditions. We provide sufficient conditions for either the smaller or the larger firm to be the first to exit in the unique equilibrium. Because of observational learning, exiting may be a firm's dominant action since continuing operation would bring too optimistic news to the rival, leading it to further postpone its exit.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20220037,Doruk Cetemen,Chiara Margaria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D21,D43,D83,L21,L25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coordination in the Fight against Collusion,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"While antitrust authorities strive to detect, prosecute, and thereby deter collusive conduct, entities harmed by that conduct are also advised to pursue their own strategies to deter collusion. The implications of such delegation of deterrence have largely been ignored, however. In a procurement context, we find that buyers may prefer to accommodate rather than deter collusion among their suppliers.

Constructive versus Toxic Argumentation in Debates,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Two debaters address an audience by sequentially choosing their information strategies. We compare the setting where the second mover reveals additional information (constructive argumentation) with the setting where the second mover obfuscates the first mover's information (toxic argumentation). We reframe both settings as constrained optimization of the first mover. We show that when the preferences are zero-sum or risk-neutral, constructive debates reveal the state, while toxic debates are completely uninformative.

Anticompetitive Bundling When Buyers Compete,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We study the profitability of bundling by an upstream firm that licenses technologies to downstream competitors and that faces competition for one of its technologies. In an otherwise standard ""Chicago-style"" model, the existence of downstream competition can make inefficient bundling profitable. Forcing downstream firms to use an inefficient technology reassures each one that it will face weak competition. This allows the upstream firm to extract more profit through its monopolized technology. A similar logic can make it profitable to degrade interoperability with rival technologies, even without foreclosing competition.

We conduct a high-stakes donation experiment that comprehensively characterizes discounting behavior in self–other trade-offs and allows us to identify different prosocial motives from their distinct time profiles.

Furthermore, swapping WTP data with choice data generated from a simple task leads to comparable performance.

Dynamic Privacy Choices,"VOL. 15, NO. 2, MAY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"I study a dynamic model of consumer privacy and platform data collection. In each period consumers choose their level of platform activity. Greater activity generates more information about the consumer, thereby increasing platform profits. When the platform can commit to the future privacy policy, it collects information by committing to gradually decreasing the level of privacy protection. In the long run consumers lose privacy and receive low payoffs but choose high activity levels. In contrast, the platform with weaker commitment power may attain the commitment outcome or fail to collect any data depending on consumer expectations regarding future privacy protection.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20210100,Shota Ichihashi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C93,D11,D82,D83,D84,L86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When censorship is inexpensive, the firm never invests and a patient firm's payoffs approach the lowest possible. In contrast, when censorship is moderately expensive, there exist equilibria where product quality is persistently high and payoffs approach the first-best, which can exceed the maximum equilibrium payoff if it was unable to censor.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20200266,Daniel N.

Togetherness in the Household,"VOL. 15, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Spending time with a spouse is a major gain from marriage. We extend the classical collective model of the household to allow for togetherness between spouses. Togetherness takes the form of joint leisure and joint care for children. Using revealed preference conditions and Dutch data over the years 2009–2012, we find that households are willing to pay €1.20 per hour—10 percent of the average wage—to convert private leisure to joint leisure and €2.10 per hour to convert private childcare to joint childcare.

Search frictions thus correct that inefficiency because search requires internalizing the utility of agents.

Contract Duration and the Costs of Market Transactions,"VOL. 14, NO. 3, AUGUST 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"The optimal duration of a supply contract balances the costs of re-selecting a supplier against the costs of being matched to an inefficient supplier when the contract lasts too long. I develop a structural model of contract duration that captures this trade-off and provide an empirical strategy for quantifying (unobserved) transaction costs. I estimate the model using federal supply contracts for a standardized product, where suppliers are selected by procurement auctions. The estimated transaction costs are substantially greater than consumer switching costs and a significant portion of total buyer costs.

A Theory of Crime and Vigilance,"VOL. 14, NO. 3, AUGUST 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper develops a theory of crime in which potential victims elect their vigilance levels. When vigilance expenses are greater than expected property losses, an increase in penalties raises crime, namely, a criminal Laffer curve emerges. This curve is higher and peaks earlier when victims face higher costs. Thus, the government may wish to subsidize vigilance rather than increase penalties. Indeed, an increase in penalties may shift the vigilance levels further away from their socially optimal ones. Finally, the crime rate first rises and then falls in the property value at stake, which is consistent with the empirical evidence.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190339,Jorge Vásquez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D91,H76,K42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bad News Turned Good: Reversal under Censorship,"VOL. 14, NO. 2, MAY 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Sellers often have the power to censor the reviews of their products. We explore the effect of these censorship policies in markets where some consumers are unaware of possible censorship.

Moreover, the structure of this arrangement is optimal both for profit-maximizing firms and for nonprofit organizations with limited resources. We test the arrangement using a field experiment in rural Uganda. We find that the model-implied optimal arrangement increased distribution significantly compared to a standard contract. However, growth was lower than predicted by the model because vendors were unwilling to extend credit to customers and did not have access to a reliable savings technology.

A Leverage Theory of Tying in Two-Sided Markets with Nonnegative Price Constraints,"VOL. 13, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Motivated by recent antitrust cases in markets with zero-pricing, we develop a leverage theory of tying in two-sided markets. In the presence of the nonnegative price constraint, the Chicago school critique of tie-ins fails to hold. In the independent products case, tying provides a mechanism to circumvent the constraint in the tied market without inviting aggressive responses by the rival firm. In the complementary products case, the ""price squeeze"" mechanism cannot be used to extract surplus from the more efficient rival firm without tying. We identify conditions under which tying in two-sided markets is profitable and explore its welfare implications.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20180234,Jay Pil Choi,Doh-Shin Jeon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D42,K21,L12,L41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Organizing Time Exchanges: Lessons from Matching Markets,"VOL. 13, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper considers time exchanges via a common platform (e.g., markets for exchanging time units, positions at education institutions, and tuition waivers). There are several problems associated with such markets, e.g., imbalanced outcomes, coordination problems, and inefficiencies. We model time exchanges as matching markets and construct a non-manipulable mechanism that selects an individually rational and balanced allocation that maximizes exchanges among the participating agents (and those allocations are efficient). This mechanism works on a preference domain whereby agents classify the goods provided by other participating agents as either unacceptable or acceptable, and for goods classified as acceptable, agents have specific upper quotas representing their maximum needs.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20180236,Tommy Andersson,Ágnes Cseh,Lars Ehlers,Albin Erlanson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C78,D47,D82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prediction: The Long and the Short of It,"VOL. 13, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Commentators often lament forecasters' inability to provide precise predictions of the long-run behavior of complex economic and physical systems. Yet their concerns often conflate the presence of substantial long-run uncertainty with the need for long-run predictability; short-run predictions can partially substitute for long-run predictions if decision-makers can adjust their activities over time. So what is the relative importance of short- and long-run predictability? We study this question in a model of rational dynamic adjustment to a changing environment. Even if adjustment costs, discount factors, and long-run uncertainty are large, short-run predictability can be much more important than long-run predictability.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20180240,Antony Millner,Daniel Heyen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D21,D81,D83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The borrower's private information about his income is the only friction. An optimal contract is collateralized when in some state, some portion of the borrower's net worth is forfeited to the lender. We show that optimal contracts are always collateralized. The total value of forfeited assets is decreasing in income, highlighting the role of collateral as a deterrent to manipulation. Some assets—those that generate consumable services—will necessarily be collateralized, while others may not be.

Searching for Service,"VOL. 12, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Since Telser (1960), there is a well-established argument that a competitive market will not provide service due to freeriding. We show that with search frictions, the market may well provide service if the cost of doing so is not too large. Any market equilibrium with service provision has two or more firms providing service, implying overprovision of service as the social optimum mandates at most one service provider. Firms that provide service and those that do not can coexist, where consumers direct their search to service providers first to obtain service, and to nonservice providers later to enjoy lower prices.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20180315,Maarten C.

Success is not guaranteed as breakthroughs are mixed with setbacks and the path of learning is typically far from smooth. How decision makers learn by trial and error and the efficacy of the process are inextricably linked to the incentives of the decision makers themselves and, in particular, to their tolerance for risk. In this paper, we develop a model of trial and error learning with risk averse agents who learn by observing the choices of earlier agents and the outcomes that are realized. We identify sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal actions. We show that behavior within each period varies in risk and performance and that a performance trap develops, such that low performing agents opt to not experiment and thus fail to gain the knowledge necessary to improve performance.

Zone Pricing in Retail Oligopoly,"VOL. 11, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We quantify the welfare effects of zone pricing, or setting common prices across distinct markets, in retail oligopoly. Although monopolists can only increase profits by price discriminating, this need not be true when firms face competition. With novel data covering the retail home-improvement industry, we find that Home Depot would benefit from finer pricing but that Lowe's would prefer coarser pricing. Zone pricing softens competition in markets where firms compete, but it shields consumers from higher prices in rural markets, where firms might otherwise exercise market power. Overall, zone pricing produces higher consumer surplus than finer price discrimination does.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20170130,Brian Adams,Kevin R.

Our experimental interface allows subjects to design a comprehensive strategy that then selects actions for them in every period. We conduct lab experiments in which subjects can adjust their strategies during a repeated game but may incur a cost for doing so. We find three main results. First, subjects learn to cooperate more when adjustments are costless than when they are costly. Second, subjects make more adjustments to their strategies when adjustments are costless, but they still make adjustments even when they are costly. Finally, we find that cooperative strategies emerge over time when adjustments are costless but not when adjustments are costly. These results highlight that within-game experimentation is critical to the rise of cooperative behavior.

Effort and skills are substitutes both in the output process (as in Holmstrom 1999) and in the skills technology. The focus is on deterministic equilibria by virtue of Gaussian learning. When effort and skills are direct inputs to production and skills are exogenous, effort can be inefficiently high in the beginning of a career. In contrast, when skills are the only input to production but accumulate through past effort choices, the worker always underinvests in skill acquisition. At the center of the discrepancy are two types of ex post errors that arise at interpreting output due to an identification problem faced by the market.

The category's competitive structure and features of the regime shift determine which of the two provides a better approximation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20140254,Matthew Osborne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C43,C51,E31,L11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Risk and Return in Village Economies,"VOL. 10, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper provides a theory-based empirical framework for understanding the risk and return on productive capital assets and their allocation across activities in an economy characterized by idiosyncratic and aggregate risk and thin formal markets for real and financial assets. We apply our framework to households running business enterprises in Thai villages with extensive networks, taking advantage of panel data: income, assets, consumption, gifts, and loans. We decompose risk and estimate the risk premia faced by households, distinguishing aggregate risk from idiosyncratic, potentially diversifiable risk.

Incomplete Disclosure: Evidence of Signaling and Countersignaling,"VOL. 10, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"In 2011, Maricopa County adopted voluntary restaurant hygiene grade cards (A, B, C, D).

Goods differ in the kinds of contracts that are appropriate for their production, and so strategic complementarities between contracts and social norms may result in a multiplicity of cultural-institutional equilibria. The resulting country differences in culture and institutions provide the basis for comparative advantage. In our evolutionary model of endogenous preferences and institutions, transitions among persistent cultural-institutional configurations occur as a result of decentralized and uncoordinated contractual or behavioral innovations by employers or employees. We show that the gains from trade raise the cost of deviations from the prevailing culture and institutions. As a result, trade liberalization impedes decentralized transitions, even to Pareto-improving cultural-institutional configurations.

In turn, this may hinder electoral selection and be detrimental to voter welfare. This is because increasing effective accountability directly impacts how informative governance outcomes are about an incumbent's type. We show that, if politicians' effort and type are local substitutes (resp. complements) in the production of governance outcomes, an increase in effective accountability corresponds to a decrease (resp. increase) in Blackwell (1951) informativeness. We also show that effective accountability can vary even absent institutional variation. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be multiple equilibria that differ in terms of both effective accountability and electoral selection. Overall, our findings have implications for voter behavior, the efficacy of institutional reforms, and voter welfare.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20150349,Scott Ashworth,Ethan Bueno de Mesquita,Amanda Friedenberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D72,D83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pricing Institutions and the Welfare Cost of Adverse Selection,"VOL. 9, NO. 2, MAY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"To mitigate adverse selection in insurance markets, individuals are often mandated to buy at least a baseline plan, but may choose to opt into a premium plan.

In other markets, such as the privately supplied ""Medigap"" top-ups to traditional government-provided Medicare, premium providers are only responsible for the incremental expenses they top up (""incremental pricing"").

How Important Can the Non-violation Clause Be for the GATT/WTO?,"VOL. 9, NO. 2, MAY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"The ""non-violation"" clause of GATT is Exhibit A for the proposition that international trade agreements are incomplete contracts.

Disclosure and Legal Advice,"VOL. 9, NO. 2, MAY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper examines how the advice that lawyers provide to their clients affects the disclosure of evidence and the outcome of adjudication, and how the adjudicator should allocate the burden of proof in light of these effects. Despite lawyers' expertise in assessing the evidence, their advice is found to have no effect on adjudication if the lawyers follow the strategies of disclosing all favorable evidence. A lawyer's advice can influence the outcome in his client's favor, either if (s)he can credibly advise his client to suppress some favorable evidence or if legal advice is costly. The effect is socially undesirable in the former case, but it is desirable in the latter case.

Designing Matching Mechanisms under General Distributional Constraints,"VOL. 9, NO. 2, MAY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"To handle various applications, we study matching under constraints. The only requirement on the constraints is heredity; given a feasible matching, any matching with fewer students at each school is also feasible. Heredity subsumes existing constraints such as regional maximum quotas and diversity constraints. With constraints, there may not exist a matching that satisfies fairness and nonwastefulness (i.e., stability). We demonstrate our new mechanism, the Adaptive Deferred Acceptance mechanism (ADA), satisfies strategy-proofness for students, nonwastefulness, and a weaker fairness property.

Intertwined matching is necessary and, in one context, sufficient for any grouping to be a potential equilibrium. But there are many intertwined matching patterns when n > 2.

In convex games, we establish that the set of these limit payoffs achievable by varying recognition rates is exactly the core of the characteristic function.

Repeated Interaction and Rating Inflation: A Model of Double Reputation,"VOL. 7, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Credit rating agencies have an incentive to maintain a public reputation for credibility among investors but also have an incentive to develop a second, private reputation for leniency among issuers. We show that in markets with few issuers, such as markets for structured assets, these incentives may lead rating agencies to inflate ratings as a strategic tool to form a ""double reputation"". The model extends the existing literature on ""cheap-talk"" reputation to the case of two audiences. Our results can explain why rating inflation occurred specifically in markets for MBSs and CDOs during the recent financial crisis. Policy implications are discussed.

Mobility and Conflict,"VOL. 7, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We study the role of intergroup mobility in the emergence of conflict. Two groups compete for the right to allocate society's resources. We allow for costly intergroup mobility. The winning group offers an allocation, which the opposition can accept or reject, and wage conflict. Agents can also switch group membership. Expropriating a large share of resources increases political strength by attracting opposition members, but implies a higher threat of conflict. Our main finding is that the possibility of intergroup mobility affects the likelihood of conflict in a nonmonotonic way. Open conflict can arise at intermediate costs of mobility.

However, when audiences separately observe different outcomes, the result is the opposite. Therefore, the agent would prefer to deal with audiences commonly.

Go Figure: The Strategy of Nonliteral Speech,"VOL. 5, NO. 2, MAY 2013",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We develop a model of figurative or indirect speech, which may convey a meaning that differs from its literal meaning. The model yields analytical conditions for speech to be figurative in equilibrium and delivers a number of comparative statics results. For instance, it predicts that the likelihood of figurative speech is greater if the benefit to the listener of correctly understanding the speaker is greater. We then apply the model to analyze particular forms of indirect speech, including terseness, irony, and veiled bribery. Interestingly, the model provides a novel argument for the effectiveness of laws that strictly punish attempted bribery. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.5.2.186,Hugo M. Mialon,Sue H.

In our main analysis, players are willing to exhibit trust and thereby facilitate cooperative gains only if such behavior is regarded as a favor that must be reciprocated, either immediately or in the future. The size of a favor owed may decline over time, following neutral periods. Indeed, a favor-exchange relationship with this feature improves on a simple favor-exchange relationship. In some settings, an infrequent and symmetric punishment sustains greater cooperation. A honeymoon period followed by favor-exchange or symmetric punishment can also offer scope for improvement.

In the Bilateralism game, countries choose whether to liberalize trade preferentially via a customs union (CU ), multilaterally, or not at all. The Multilateralism game is a restricted version of the Bilateralism game in that countries cannot form CUs and can only undertake non-discriminatory trade liberalization. When countries have symmetric endowments, global free trade is the only stable equilibrium of both games. Allowing for endowment asymmetry, we isolate circumstances where the option to form CUs helps further the cause of multilateral liberalization as well as where it does not.

Pairwise stability holds in some theoretical models of simultaneous ascending auctions under intimidatory collusion and demand reduction. Pairwise stability results in a matching game approach to estimation. We find that a system of four large regional licenses would raise the allocative efficiency of the C block outcome by 48 percent.

Agents take a decision in sequence, after observing their predecessors and a private signal.

We show that, in a discrete action space, even if agents receive signals of unbounded precision, there are asymptotic inefficiencies. In a continuous action space, compared to the rational case, agents overweight early signals. Despite this behavioral bias, eventually agents learn the realized state of the world and choose the correct action.

The key idea is evolutionary selection among heterogeneous expectation rules, driven by their relative performance.

The Impact of Social Ties on Group Interactions: Evidence from Minimal Groups and Randomly Assigned Real Groups,"VOL. 4, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Economists are increasingly interested in how group membership affects individual behavior. The standard method assigns individuals to ""minimal"" groups, i.e. arbitrary labels, in a lab. But real group often involve social interactions leading to social ties between group members. Our experiments compare randomly assigned minimal groups to randomly assigned groups involving real social interactions. While adding social ties leads to qualitatively similar, although stronger, in-group favoritism in cooperation, altruistic norm enforcement patterns are qualitatively different between treatments. Our findings contribute to the micro-foundation of theories of group preferences, and caution against generalizations from ""minimal"" groups to groups with social context.

Using US consumer price index microdata to track inventory shortfalls, I find that taking on high financial leverage increases shortfalls. Highly leveraged firms appear to be degrading their products' quality in order to preserve current cash flow for debt service. Although reducing quality can erode both current sales and customer loyalty, firms appear to be willing to risk these outcomes in order to achieve benefits associated with debt finance.

A Welfare Analysis of Arbitration,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"The paper compares conventional and final-offer arbitration. One party is supposed to make a payment to another party, whose amount depends on a state. Under one scenario, parties obtain signals about the state, which cannot be recognized by the opponents. If the arbitrator's ability of recognizing signals is high, the frequency of requesting arbitration is lower under conventional than under final-offer arbitration. If this ability is low, final-offer arbitration dominates conventional arbitration in quite a similar sense. Under the second scenario, parties believe that their opponents have wrong signals. Then, conventional arbitration approximates the original outcome better than final-offer arbitration.

Sex Selection and Gender Balance,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We model the equilibrium sex ratio when parents can choose the sex of their child. With intrinsic son preference, sex selection results in a male-biased sex ratio. This is inefficient due to a marriage market congestion externality. Medical innovations that facilitate selection aggravate the inefficiency. If son preference arises endogenously, due to population growth causing an excess supply of women on the marriage market, selection may improve welfare. Empirically, sex selection causes an excess of males and reduces welfare in China. In most parts of India, cohort sizes are growing, implying an excess supply of women.

Ensuring Sales: A Theory of Inter-firm Credit,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We propose a simple theory to account for the prevalence of interfirm credit at an interest rate of zero. A downstream firm trades off inventory holding costs against lost sales. Lost final sales impose a negative externality on the upstream firm. The solution requires a subsidy limited by the value of inputs. Allowing the downstream firm to pay with a delay is precisely such a solution. A reverse externality accounts for the use of prepayment. We clarify how input prices vary with such policies, and when trade credit/prepayment is more efficient than pure input price adjustments.

Greater inequality of rewards hurts most people -- both the middle class and the poor -- who are forced into greater effort. Conversely, greater inequality of endowments benefits the middle class.

Dictator offers are primarily explained by social distance, giving follows a simple inverse distance law. While student demographics play a minor role in explaining offer amounts, individual heterogeneity is important for network formation. In particular, we detect significant homophilous behavior; students connect to others similar to themselves. Moreover, the network data reveal a strong preference for cliques, students connect to those already close. The study is one of the first to identify network architecture with individual behavior in a strategic context. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.2.1.183,Jacob K. Goeree,Margaret A.

The Strategic Value of Quantity Forcing Contracts,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We explore the strategic value of quantity forcing contracts in a manufacturer-retailer environment under both adverse selection and moral hazard. Manufacturers dealing with (exclusive) competing retailers may prefer to leave contracts silent on retail prices, whenever other aspects of the retailers' activity remain nonverifiable. Two effects are at play when moving from retail price maintenance to quantity forcing. First, restricting screening possibilities may increase retailers' rent. Second, such a restriction affects downstream competition. This latter effect may justify using quantity forcing contracts and, more generally, shed light on a novel source of contractual incompleteness.

"Competition, Monopoly Maintenance, and Consumer Switching Costs","VOL. 2, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Significant attention has been paid to why a durable goods producer with little or no market power would monopolize the maintenance market for its own product. This paper investigates an explanation for the practice based on consumer switching costs and the decision concerning maintaining versus replacing used units. In our explanation, if the maintenance market is not monopolized, consumers sometimes maintain used units that are more efficiently replaced. In turn, monopolizing the maintenance market avoids this inefficiency. In contrast to most previous explanations for the practice, in our explanation, the practice increases both social and consumer welfare.

Sniping and Squatting in Auction Markets,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We conducted a field experiment to test the benefit from late bidding (sniping) in online auction markets. We compared sniping to early bidding (squatting) in auctions for newly-released DVDs on eBay. Sniping led to a statistically significant increase in our average surplus. However, this improvement was small. The two bidding strategies resulted in a variety of other qualitative differences in the outcomes of auctions. We show that a model of multiple concurrent auctions, in which our opponents are naive or incremental bidders as identified in the lab, explain the results well. Our findings illustrate how the overall impact of naivete, and the benefit from sniping observed in the lab, may be substantially attenuated in real-world market settings.

With ""integer assignment messages,"" there exist integer-valued Walrasian allocations, extending a result of Lloyd S. Shapley and Martin Shubik (1971). Any pure Nash equilibrium profile of the Walrasian mechanism with participants limited to assignment messages is also a Nash equilibrium of the unrestricted Walrasian mechanism. Assignment exchanges are generalizations of single-product double auctions and are related to ascending multi-product clock auctions and the Vickrey mechanism. Assignment messages also have additional applications in mechanism design. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.2.95,Paul Milgrom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D44,D82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trading in Networks: A Normal Form Game Experiment,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper reports an experimental study of trading networks. Networks are incomplete in the sense that each trader can only exchange assets with a limited number of other traders. The greater the incompleteness of the network, the more intermediation is required to transfer the assets between initial and final owners. The uncertainty of trade in networks constitutes a potentially important market friction. Nevertheless, we find the pricing behavior observed in the laboratory converges to competitive equilibrium behavior in a variety of treatments. However, the rate of convergence varies depending on the network, pricing rule, and payoff function. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.2.114,Douglas M.

Incentive Reversal,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,By incentive reversal we refer to situations in which an increase in rewards for all agents results in fewer agents exerting effort. We show that externalities among peers may give rise to such intriguing situations even when all agents are fully rational. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the organizational technology so that it will be susceptible to incentive reversal. The condition implies that some degree of complementarity is enough to allow incentive reversal. ,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.2.133,Eyal Winter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D23,D82,M54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dynamic Revenue Maximization with Heterogeneous Objects: A Mechanism Design Approach,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"We study the revenue-maximizing allocation of several heterogeneous, commonly ranked objects to impatient agents with privately known characteristics who arrive sequentially. There is a deadline after which no more objects can be allocated. We first characterize implementable allocation schemes, and compute the expected revenue for any implementable, deterministic and Markovian allocation policy. The revenue-maximizing policy is obtained by a variational argument which sheds more light on its properties than the usual dynamic programming approach. Finally, we use our main result in order to derive the optimal inventory choice, and explain empirical regularities about pricing in clearance sales.

Market Culture: How Rules Governing Exploding Offers Affect Market Performance,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, AUGUST 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"Many markets encounter difficulty maintaining a thick marketplace because they experience transactions made at dispersed times. To address such problems, many markets try to establish norms concerning when offers can be made, accepted, and rejected. Examining such markets suggests it is difficult to establish a thick market at an efficient time if firms can make exploding offers, and workers cannot renege on early commitments. Laboratory experiments allow us to isolate the effects of exploding offers and binding acceptances. In a simple experiment, we find inefficient early contracting when firms can make exploding offers and applicants' acceptances are binding.

While it is common to ascribe negative effects to such bribes, we show that given reputational concerns, bribes can play a positive role by restoring truthful communication that would otherwise not occur. Thus, while bribes can influence self-interested bad advisors to lie about the unfavorable state, they can also be used to motivate good advisors who care more about the decision maker's utility to truthfully report the favorable state.

Assessing Strategic Risk,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"In recent decades, subjective probabilities have been increasingly applied to an adversary's choices in strategic games (SGs). In games against nature (GANs), the subjective probability of a state can be elicited from lotteries yielding utility 1 if that state obtains, 0 otherwise. But in SGs, making such a lottery available changes the game, and so the players' incentives. Here, we propose a definition of subjective probabilities in SGs that uses actually available strategies only. The definition applies also to GANs where the decision maker's options are restricted. The probabilities that emerge need not be unique, but expected utilities are unique. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.1.1,R. J. Aumann,J. H.

Asymmetric Networks in Two-Sided Markets,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MICROECONOMICS,"This paper investigates pricing decisions and network choices in two-sided markets with network externalities. Consumers are heterogeneous in how much they value the externality. Imposing restrictions on the extent of coordination failure among consumers generates clear qualitative conclusions about equilibrium market configurations. Multiple asymmetric networks can coexist in equilibrium, both in the case of a monopolist network provider and in the case of competing providers. These equilibria have the property that one network is cheaper and larger on one side, while the other network is cheaper and larger on the other side. Product differentiation is endogenized by consumers' network choices.

We also find a strong ""home bias"" for trading with counterparties located in the same city. Further analyses suggest that location-specific goods such as opera tickets, cultural factors, and the possibility of direct contract enforcement in case of breach may be the main reasons behind the same-city bias.

FFPs ""bribe"" employees to book flights at higher prices. While a single airline offering an FFP has an advantage, competing FFPs can result in lower profits for airlines even while ticket prices rise. Thus, in contrast to switching-cost treatments of FFPs, we may observe prices and profits moving in opposite directions. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.1.101,Leonardo J.

We show that overlap in the state of a parent and child's neighborhood can lead to correlation in parent-child behavior independent of any parent-child interaction. Increasing the sensitivity of individual decisions to the state of their social community leads to increased parent-child correlation and less efficient (more costly) behavior on average in the society. We show this model is distinguished from a direct parental influence model, in that it predicts increased generational effects, implying residual correlation between children and grandparents after including parental information.
