Affirmative Action and Precollege Human Capital,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Though racial affirmative action (AA) policies are widespread in college admissions, evidence on their effects before college is limited. We study a US Supreme Court ruling that reinstated AA in three states. Using nationwide SAT data, we separately identify positive effects of AA for Whites and underrepresented minorities. Using Texas administrative data, we find that AA narrowed racial gaps in grades, attendance, and college applications. Improvements in minorities precollege human capital and college applications are concentrated in the top half of the test score distribution among the students for whom the policy most increases the returns to human capital investment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20210807,Mitra Akhtari,Natalie Bau,Jean-William Laliberté,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H75,I21,I23,I28,J15,J24,K10,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Estimating the Distaste for Price Gouging with Incentivized Consumer Reports,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Thirty-four states prohibit price increases during emergencies, and individuals take costly actions to report violators. We measure experimentally the willingness to pay to report sellers who increase prices of personal protective equipment. Over 75 percent of subjects pay to report, even if others are willing to buy at those prices. We argue that reports contain information about a desire to prevent or punish third-party transactions at unfair or illicit prices.

The Unintended Consequences of Test-Based Remediation,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"School systems around the world use achievement tests to assign students to schools, classes, and instructional resources, including remediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, we study a Florida policy that places middle school students who score below a proficiency cutoff into remedial classes. Students scoring below the cutoff receive more educational resources, but they are also placed in classes that are more segregated by race, socioeconomic status, and prior achievement. Increased tracking occurs not only in the remedial subject, but in other core subjects.

The Impact of Youth Medicaid Eligibility on Adult Incarceration,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such decline.

Seven years later, participants randomly assigned to serve in a state with a different ethnic majority are five times more likely to live all across the country compared to those who served in their ethnic region. They have more interethnic romantic relationships and express greater national pride. Nevertheless, immersion in a different region strengthens participants' ethnic pride and favorable attitudes toward co-ethnics.

The estimated MTEs reveal that school choice is not random and that the average student experiences significant improvements in both math and Spanish after just one year of attendance in telesecundarias.

Does Discipline Decrease Police Misconduct? Evidence from Chicago Civilian Allegations,"VOL. 15, NO. 3, JULY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Reformers are calling for greater oversight of police behavior, in part through enhanced use of civilian complaints. However, others counter that greater oversight could chill effective policing. We assess police officer response to administrative determinations of misconduct. Using Chicago data, we find strong evidence that a sustained allegation reduces that officer's future misconduct. We find no evidence that this effect is driven by incapacitation, such as assignment to desk duty, or by officer disengagement. We conclude that our findings are most consistent with improved officer conduct, in part from oversight and officer concerns over promotion, salary, and desirable assignments.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20200568,Kyle Rozema,Max Schanzenbach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H76,J45,K42,M54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use two randomized controlled trials in Bangladesh to study the relationship between marginal prices, adoption of a water-saving technology, and water usage. Our first experiment shows that the technology only saves water when farmers face marginal prices. Our second experiment finds that an encouragement to voluntarily convert to hourly pumping charges does not save water. Taken together, efforts to conserve water work best when farmers face marginal prices, but simply giving an option for marginal pricing is insufficient to trigger water-saving investments and reduce irrigation demands.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20210011,Ujjayant Chakravorty,Manzoor H.

This hometown effect is similar throughout the auditor's tenure and is diminished for audits ordered by the provincial Organization Department as a result of the departure of top city officials. We argue that our findings are most readily explained by leniency toward local officials rather than an endogenous response to concerns of better enforcement by hometown auditors.

Uber versus Taxi: A Driver's Eye View,"VOL. 13, NO. 3, JULY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Rideshare drivers pay a proportion of their fares to a ride-hailing platform operator, a commission-based compensation model used by many service providers. To Uber drivers, this commission is known as the Uber fee.

We assess these compensation models using an experiment that offered random samples of Boston Uber drivers opportunities to lease a virtual taxi medallion that eliminates the Uber fee. Some drivers were offered a negative fee. Drivers' labor supply response to our offers reveals a large intertemporal substitution elasticity, on the order of 1.2, and higher for those who accept lease contracts. At the same time, our virtual lease program was undersubscribed: many drivers who would have benefited from buying an inexpensive lease chose to sit out. We use these results to compute the average compensation required to make drivers indifferent between rideshare and taxi-style compensation contracts.

The greater turbulence following macro shocks may benefit decentralized firms because the value of local information increases (the ""localist"" view). On the other hand, the need to make tough decisions may favor centralized firms (the ""centralist"" view). Using two large micro datasets on decentralization in firms in ten OECD countries (WMS) and US establishments (MOPS administrative data), we find that firms that delegated more power from the central headquarters to local plant managers prior to the Great Recession outperformed their centralized counterparts in sectors that were hardest hit by the subsequent crisis (as measured by export growth and product durability). Results based on measures of turbulence based on product churn and stock market volatility provide further support to the localist view. This conclusion is robust to alternative explanations such as managerial fears of bankruptcy and changing coordination costs. Although decentralization will be suboptimal in many environments, it does appear to be beneficial for the average firm during bad times.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180752,Philippe Aghion,Nicholas Bloom,Brian Lucking,Raffaella Sadun,John Van Reenen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D22,G12,G32,G34,L23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Energy Cost Pass-Through in US Manufacturing: Estimates and Implications for Carbon Taxes,"VOL. 12, NO. 2, APRIL 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We study how changes in energy input costs for US manufacturers affect the relative welfare of manufacturing producers and consumers (i.e., incidence). We also develop a methodology to estimate the incidence of input taxes that accounts for incomplete pass-through, imperfect competition, and substitution among inputs. For the several industries we study, 70 percent of energy price-driven changes in input costs get passed through to consumers in the short to medium run. The share of the welfare cost that consumers bear is 25–75 percent smaller (and the share producers bear is larger) than models featuring complete pass-through and perfect competition would suggest.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180474,Sharat Ganapati,Joseph S.

Trade and Income—Exploiting Time Series in Geography,"VOL. 11, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Establishing a robust causal relationship between trade and income has been difficult. Frankel and Romer (1999) uses a geographic instrument to identify a positive effect of trade on income. Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) shows that these results are not robust to controlling for omitted variables such as distance to the equator or institutions. This paper solves the omitted variable problem by generating a time-varying geographic instrument. Improvements in aircraft technology have caused the quantity of world trade carried by air to increase over time. Country pairs with relatively short air routes compared to sea routes benefit more from this change in technology. This heterogeneity can be used to generate a geography-based instrument for trade that varies over time. The time-series variation allows for controls for country fixed effects, eliminating the bias from time-invariant variables such as distance from the equator or historically determined institutions. Trade has a significant effect on income with an elasticity of roughly one-half. Differences in predicted trade growth can explain roughly 17 percent of the variation in cross-country income growth between 1960 and 1995.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20170616,James Feyrer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F14,F43,L93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These innovations raised the rate of early initiation of prenatal care by 34 percent while the incentives were being paid in the treatment period. We also find that this increase persisted for at least 24 months after the incentives ended.

Family Disadvantage and the Gender Gap in Behavioral and Educational Outcomes,"VOL. 11, NO. 3, JULY 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Boys born to disadvantaged families have higher rates of disciplinary problems, lower achievement scores, and fewer high school completions than girls from comparable backgrounds. Using birth certificates matched to schooling records for Florida children born 1992–2002, we find that family disadvantage disproportionately impedes the pre-market development of boys. The differential effect of family disadvantage on boys is robust to specifications within schools and neighborhoods as well as across siblings within families. Evidence supports that this is the effect of the postnatal environment; family disadvantage is unrelated to the gender gap in neonatal health. We conclude that the gender gap among black children is larger than among white children in substantial part because black children are raised in more disadvantaged families.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20170571,David Autor,David Figlio,Krzysztof Karbownik,Jeffrey Roth,Melanie Wasserman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D91,I24,I32,J13,J15,J16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While inflating a score increases the probability of a student graduating from high school by about 17 percentage points, the probability of taking advanced coursework declines by roughly 10 percentage points. We argue that these results are consistent with test score manipulation helping less advanced students on the margin of dropping out but hurting more advanced students that are not pushed to gain a solid foundation in the introductory material.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20170520,Thomas S.

We make use of a parental leave reform in Sweden that earmarked one month of paid leave to each parent in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) framework. Couples who were affected by the reform increased the take-up of fathers' leave but also increased their probability of separation compared to unaffected couples. We argue that the separation effect can be explained by the degree of restrictiveness of the policy in combination with role conflicts in traditional family constellations.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160426,Daniel Avdic,Arizo Karimi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D13,J12,J13,J16,J32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that unexpected losses increase sentence lengths assigned by judges during the week following the game. Unexpected wins, or losses that were expected to be close contests ex ante have no impact. The effects of these emotional shocks are asymmetrically borne by black defendants. The impact of upset losses on sentence lengths is larger for defendants if their cases are handled by judges who received their bachelor's degrees from the university with which the football team is affiliated. Different falsification tests and a number of auxiliary analyses demonstrate the robustness of the findings. These results provide evidence for the impact of emotions in one domain on decisions in a completely unrelated domain among a uniformly highly educated group of individuals (judges) who make decisions after deliberation that involve high stakes (sentence lengths).

I also directly estimate peer effects using random variation in peer groups across dormitories. Living with higher-scoring peers raises students' GPAs, particularly for low-scoring students, and peer effects are stronger between socially proximate students.

Ethnolinguistic Favoritism in African Politics,"VOL. 10, NO. 3, JULY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"African political leaders have a tendency to favor members of their own ethnic group.

Combined with panel data on 163 ethnic groups partitioned across 35 sub-Saharan countries, I use within-group time variation in similarity that results from a partitioned group's concurrent exposure to multiple national leaders. Findings show that ethnic favoritism is more widespread than previously believed: in addition to evidence of coethnic favoritism, I document evidence of non-coethnic favoritism that typically goes undetected in the absence of a continuous measure of similarity. I also find that patronage tends to be targeted toward ethnic regions rather than individuals of a particular ethnic group.

The increase in education among rural women led to an increase in self-reported psychological violence and financial control behavior, without changes in physical violence, partner characteristics, or women's attitudes towards such violence.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160278,Bilge Erten,Pinar Keskin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I21,I28,J12,J16,J24,O15,O18,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Demand for Alcohol Consumption in Russia and Its Implication for Mortality,"VOL. 10, NO. 1, JANUARY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Alcohol abuse is widely blamed for the very high rate of male mortality in Russia. I estimate a structural model of the demand for alcohol that incorporates two features of alcohol consumption, peer effects and habits. I use a kink in the policy regime of the excise tax on alcohol and regional variation in alcohol regulations to estimate a price elasticity of demand for alcohol. I find that peer influence and habits are critical determinants of the response of alcohol demand to price changes.

Free to Choose: Can School Choice Reduce Student Achievement?,"VOL. 10, NO. 1, JANUARY 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"A central argument for school choice is that parents can choose schools wisely.

We use randomized lotteries to evaluate the Louisiana Scholarship Program, a voucher plan that provides public funds for disadvantaged students to attend private schools. LSP participation lowers math scores by 0.4 standard deviations and also reduces achievement in reading, science, and social studies.

We assess the impact of a voter awareness campaign on female turnout, candidate choice and party vote shares. Geographic clusters within villages were randomly assigned to treatment or control, and within treated clusters, some households were not targeted. Compared to women in control clusters, both targeted and untargeted women in treated clusters are 11 percentage points more likely to vote, and are also more likely to exercise independence in candidate choice, indicating large spillovers. Data from polling stations suggests that treating 10 women increased female turnout by about seven votes, resulting in a cost per vote of US$3.1.

This change in life expectancy has potentially profound influences on life-cycle decisions. A longer life expectancy increases the value of human capital investment, while the effect on savings is theoretically ambiguous and life-cycle saving could increase or decrease. This paper uses spatial and temporal variation in ART availability to evaluate the impact of ART provision on savings and investment. We find that ART availability significantly increases savings, expenditures on education, and children's schooling, including among HIV-negative individuals who do not directly benefit from ART. These results are not driven by the direct health effects of treatment or reductions in caretaking responsibilities, but rather by reduced perceptions of mortality risk after ART has become available.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150369,Victoria Baranov,Hans-Peter Kohler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D14,D15,I12,I15,J24,O12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persuasion: A Case Study of Papal Influences on Fertility-Related Beliefs and Behavior,"VOL. 9, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We study the persuasive impacts of non-informative communication on the short-run beliefs and long-run behavior of individuals. We do so in the context of the Papal visit to Brazil in October 1991, in which persuasive messages related to fertility were salient in Papal speeches during the visit. We use individual's exposure to such messages to measure how persuasion shifts short-run beliefs such as intentions to contracept and long-term fertility outcomes such as the timing and total number of births. To measure the short-run causal impact of persuasion, we exploit the fact the Brazil 1991 DHS was fielded in the weeks before, during, and after the Papal visit. We use this fortuitous timing to identify that persuasion significantly reduced individual intentions to contracept by more than 40 percent relative to pre-visit levels, and increased the frequency of unprotected sex by 30 percent. We measure the long-run causal impacts of persuasion on fertility outcomes using later DHS surveys to conduct an event study analysis on births in a five-year window on either side of the 1991 Papal visit. Estimating a hazard model of fertility, we find a significant change in births 9 months post-visit, corresponding to a 1.6 percent increase in the aggregate birth cohort.

Using data from a large representative household survey, we employ a triple difference approach (using boys and the neighboring state of Jharkhand as comparison groups) and find that being in a cohort that was exposed to the Cycle program increased girls' age-appropriate enrollment in secondary school by 32 percent and reduced the corresponding gender gap by 40 percent. We also find an 18 percent increase in the number of girls who appear for the high-stakes secondary school certificate exam, and a 12 percent increase in the number of girls who pass it. Parametric and non-parametric decompositions of the triple- difference estimate as a function of distance to the nearest secondary school show that the increases in enrollment mostly took place in villages that were further away from a secondary school, suggesting that the mechanism of impact was the reduction in the time and safety cost of school attendance made possible by the bicycle.

Our analysis suggests that the emergence of a price-sensitive, new middle class aided the staggering growth of a fringe of generic producers. Our estimated demand model rationalizes a drastic price cut, led by Coca-Cola, that allowed it to contain the fringe's growth.

Hassle Costs and Price Discrimination: An Empirical Welfare Analysis,"VOL. 7, NO. 3, JULY 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"This paper studies a market where soda is sold in both refillable and nonrefillable bottles. Purchasing refillables is inconvenient but cheaper. Using a discrete choice model, I find that price-sensitive customers put less weight on the inconveniences of purchasing refillables. This implies that a retailer can target lower prices to price-sensitive customers using the refillable segment. I evaluate the overall welfare consequences of this market segmentation and find that both customer welfare and profits would decrease (by 12.61 and 4.21 percent, respectively) if the refillables were removed, as there would be an important market-shrinkage effect.

Theoretically, I show that Medicaid expansions can combat adverse selection by removing high cost individuals from the relevant risk pool.

Using administrative micro-data from Missouri, we decompose the graduation gap into racial differences in four factors: (i) how students sort to universities, (ii) how students sort to initial majors, (iii) high-school quality, and (iv) other preentry skills. Preentry skills explain 65 and 86 percent of the gap for women and men respectively. A small role is found for differential sorting into college, driven by African Americans' disproportionate representation in urban schools and schools at the very bottom of the quality distribution.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.6.3.20,Peter Arcidiacono,Cory Koedel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H75,I21,I23,J15,R23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exchange rate effect is greater for recent immigrants, married immigrants with absent spouses, Mexicans close to the border, and immigrants from countries with higher remittance flows. A neoclassical interpretation of these findings suggests that the income effect exceeds the cross-substitution effect.

Evidence from the Peacetime Draft in Portugal,"VOL. 4, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We provide new evidence on the long-term impacts of peacetime conscription, using longitudinal data for Portuguese men born in 1967. These men were inducted at age 21, allowing us to use preconscription wages to control for ability differences between conscripts and nonconscripts. We find a significant 4-5 percentage point impact of service on the wages of men with only primary education, coupled with a zero effect for men with higher education. The effect for less-educated men suggests that mandatory service can be a valuable experience for those who might otherwise spend their careers in low-level jobs.

Limited Insurance within the Household: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Kenya,"VOL. 4, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2012",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"In developing countries, unexpected income shocks are common but informal insurance is typically incomplete. An important question is therefore whether risk-sharing within the household is effective. This paper presents results from a field experiment with 142 married couples in Kenya in which individuals were given random income shocks. Even though the shocks were small relative to lifetime income, men increase private consumption when they receive the shock but not when their wives do, a rejection of efficiency. Such behavior is not specific to the experiment—both spouses spend more on themselves when their labor income is higher.

Our evidence suggests that this increase is good news, driven primarily by greater reporting rather than greater incidence of such crimes. In contrast, we find no increase in crimes against men or in gender-neutral crimes. We also examine the effectiveness of alternative forms of political representation.

We find that deregulation and consolidation are associated with a 10 percent increase in operating performance, achieved primarily by reducing the duration of reactor outages.

Results suggest that cash transfers can achieve long-term increases in consumption through investment in productive activities, thereby permitting beneficiary households to attain higher living standards that are sustained even after transitioning off the program.

The Labor Market Returns to Cognitive and Noncognitive Ability: Evidence from the Swedish Enlistment,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We use data from the Swedish military enlistment to assess the importance of cognitive and noncognitive ability for labor market outcomes. The measure of noncognitive ability is based on a personal interview conducted by a psychologist. We find strong evidence that men who fare poorly in the labor market—in the sense of unemployment or low annual earnings—lack noncognitive rather than cognitive ability. However, cognitive ability is a stronger predictor of wages for skilled workers and of earnings above the median.

Minimum Wages and Firm Profitability,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We study the impact of minimum wages on firm profitability, exploiting the changes induced by the introduction of a UK national minimum wage in 1999. We use pre-policy information on the distribution of wages to implement a difference-in-differences approach. Minimum wages raise wages, but also significantly reduce profitability (especially in industries with relatively high market power). This is consistent with a simple model where wage gains from minimum wages map directly into profit reductions. There is some suggestive evidence of longer run adjustment to the minimum wage through falls in net entry rates.

Are Restaurants Really Supersizing America?,"VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"While many researchers and policymakers infer from correlations between eating out and body weight that restaurants are a leading cause of obesity, a basic identification problem challenges these conclusions. We exploit the placement of Interstate Highways in rural areas to obtain exogenous variation in the effective price of restaurants and examine the impact on body mass. We find no causal link between restaurant consumption and obesity. Analysis of food-intake micro-data suggests that consumers offset calories from restaurant meals by eating less at other times.

An Empirical Analysis of the Gender Gap in Mathematics,"VOL. 2, NO. 2, APRIL 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We document and analyze the emergence of a substantial gender gap in mathematics in the early years of schooling using a large, recent, and nationally representative panel of US children. There are no mean differences between boys and girls upon entry to school, but girls lose more than two-tenths of a standard deviation relative to boys over the first six years of school. The ground lost by girls relative to boys is roughly half as large as the black-white test score gap that appears over these same ages. We document the presence of this gender math gap across every strata of society. We explore a wide range of possible explanations in the data, including less investment by girls in math, low parental expectations, and biased tests, but find little support for these theories. Moving to cross-country comparisons, we find earlier results linking the gender gap in math to measures of gender equality are sensitive to the inclusion of Muslim countries, where, in spite of women's low status, there is little or no gender gap in math.

We apply this novel identification structure to study peer effects in the choice of college major. Results show that one is more likely to choose a major when many of her peers make the same choice. We also show that peers can divert students from majors in which they have a relative ability advantage, with adverse consequences on academic performance, entry wages, and job satisfaction.

The Changing Consequences of Attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities,"VOL. 2, NO. 1, JANUARY 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"Using nationally representative data files from 1970s and 1990s college attendees, we find that in the 1970s matriculation at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) was associated with higher wages and an increased probability of graduation, relative to attending a traditionally white institution. By the 1990s, there is a wage penalty resulting in a 20 percent decline in the relative wages of HBCU graduates between the two decades. There is modest support for the possibility that the relative decline in wages associated with HBCU matriculation is partially due to improvements in TWIs' effectiveness at educating blacks.

This discrepancy appears due to systematic avoidance behavior of two kinds.

History Matters: The Long-Term Impact of Colonial Public Investments in French West Africa,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, APRIL 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"To what extent do colonial public investments continue to influence current regional inequalities in French-speaking West Africa? Using a new database and the spatial discontinuities of colonial investment policy, this paper gives evidence that early colonial investments had large and persistent effects on current outcomes. The nature of investments also matters. Current educational outcomes have been more specifically determined by colonial investments in education rather than health and infrastructures, and vice versa. I show that a major channel for this historical dependency is a strong persistence of investments; regions that got more at the early colonial times continued to get more.

Educational Debt Burden and Career Choice: Evidence from a Financial Aid Experiment at NYU Law School,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"This paper examines the influence of psychological responses to debt on career choices from an experiment in which alternative financial aid packages were assigned by lottery to a set of law school admits. The packages had equivalent monetary value, but one required the student to take on a loan that would be paid for by the school if he worked in public interest law, while the other covered tuition as long as the student worked in public interest law. If he did not, the student would be required to reimburse the school. Tuition assistance recipients have a 36 to 45 percent higher public interest placement rate and, when lottery results were announced before enrollment, were twice as likely to enroll.

Labor Supply Responses to Large Social Transfers: Longitudinal Evidence from South Africa,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We quantify the labor supply responses of prime-aged adults to the presence of pensioners in their households, using longitudinal data collected in South Africa. We compare households and individuals before and after pension receipt and pension loss, which allows us to control for a host of unobservable household and individual characteristics that may determine labor market behavior. We find large cash transfers to the elderly lead to increased employment among prime-aged adults, which occurs primarily through labor migration. The pension's impact is attributable to the increase in household resources it represents, which can be used to stake migrants until they become self-sufficient, and to the presence of pensioners who can care for small children, which allows prime-aged adults to look for work elsewhere.

Separated at Girth: US Twin Estimates of the Effects of Birth Weight,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"The fetal origins hypothesis asserts that nutrient deprivation in utero can raise chronic disease risk. Within economics, this hypothesis has gained acceptance as a leading explanation for the correlations between birth weight, a proxy for fetal nutrient intake, and adult outcomes. Exploiting birth-weight differences between twins using (a) a newlycreated dataset of twins from 1960-1982 California birth records and (b) the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, I find birth weight is related to educational attainment, later pregnancy complications, and the birth weight of the next generation. These effects are generally small. However, the protective effects of birth weight vary across the birth-weight distribution.

Sticking with Your Vote: Cognitive Dissonance and Political Attitudes,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that the act of voting for a candidate leads to a more favorable opinion of the candidate in the future. We find support for the empirical relevance of cognitive dissonance to political attitudes. We examine the presidential opinion ratings of voting-age eligibles and ineligibles two years after the president's election. We find that eligibles show two to three times greater polarization of opinions than comparable ineligibles. We find smaller effects when we compare polarization in opinions of senators elected during high turnout presidential campaign years with senators elected during nonpresidential campaign years. ,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.1.1.86,Sendhil Mullainathan,Ebonya Washington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Children Left Behind? Textbooks and Test Scores in Kenya,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"A randomized evaluation in rural Kenya finds, contrary to the previous literature, that providing textbooks did not raise average test scores. Textbooks did increase the scores of the best students (those with high pretest scores) but had little effect on other students. Textbooks are written in English, most students' third language, and many students could not use them effectively. More generally, the curriculum in Kenya, and in many other developing countries, tends to be oriented toward academically strong students, leaving many students behind in societies that combine a centralized educational system; the heterogeneity in student preparation associated with rapid educational expansion; and disproportionate elite power.

Incentives and Services for College Achievement: Evidence from a Randomized Trial,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"This paper reports on an experimental evaluation of strategies designed to improve academic performance among college freshmen. One treatment group was offered academic support services. Another was offered financial incentives for good grades. A third group combined both interventions. Service use was highest for women and for subjects in the combined group. The combined treatment also raised the grades and improved the academic standing of women. These differentials persisted through the end of second year, though incentives were given in the first year only. This suggests study skills among some treated women increased. In contrast, the program had no effect on men. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.1.1.136,Joshua Angrist,Daniel Lang,Philip Oreopoulos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I21,I28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"We estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on mortality using the minimum drinking age in a regression discontinuity design. We find large and immediate increases in drinking at age 21, including a 21 percent increase in recent drinking days. We also find a discrete 9 percent increase in the mortality rate at age 21, primarily due to motor vehicle accidents, alcohol-related deaths, and suicides. We estimate a 10 percent increase in the number of drinking days for young adults results in a 4.3 percent increase in mortality. Our results suggest policies that reduce drinking among young adults can have substantial public health benefits.

"Biological Gender Differences, Absenteeism, and the Earnings Gap","VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"In most countries, women are absent from work more frequently than men. Using personnel data, we find that the absences of women below the age of 45 follow a 28-day cycle, while the absences of men and of women over the age of 45 do not. We interpret this as evidence that the menstrual cycle increases female absenteeism. To investigate the effect on women's earnings, we use a simple model of statistical discrimination. Consistent with the model, we find absenteeism has a more negative effect on men's earnings and this difference declines with seniority. The increased absenteeism induced by the 28-day cycle explains at least 14 percent of the earnings gender differential.

Fixing Market Failures or Fixing Elections? Agricultural Credit in India,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"This paper integrates theories of political budget cycles with theories of tactical electoral redistribution to test for political capture in a novel way. Studying banks in India, I find that government-owned bank lending tracks the electoral cycle, with agricultural credit increasing by 5-10 percentage points in an election year. There is significant cross-sectional targeting, with large increases in districts in which the election is particularly close. This targeting does not occur in nonelection years or in private bank lending. I show capture is costly: elections affect loan repayment, and election-year credit booms do not measurably affect agricultural output.

The Social Multiplier and Labor Market Participation of Mothers,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS,"In France, as in the US, a mother's labor market participation is influenced by the sex composition of her two eldest siblings. This paper shows that it is also affected by the sex composition of the eldest siblings of the other mothers living in the same close neighborhood. Using the sex composition of neighbors' eldest siblings as an instrumental variable, we identify a significant elasticity of own labor market participation to neighbors' participation. We present supportive evidence by comparing the estimates under two regimes for family benefits (pre- and post-1994 reform) and using quarter of birth as an alternative instrument.
