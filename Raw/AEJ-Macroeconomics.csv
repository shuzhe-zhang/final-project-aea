Monetary Policy When the Phillips Curve Is Quite Flat,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper highlights how the presence of a monetary policy cost channel can offer new insights into the relation between monetary policy and inflation when the Phillips curve is quite flat. For instance, we highlight a key condition whereby lax monetary policy can push the economy to a low-inflation trap, and we discuss how, under the same condition, standard policy rules targeting inflation may need to be modified. In the empirical part of the paper, we explore the relevance of the condition that gives rise to these observations. The results support the key condition we emphasize.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20220088,Paul Beaudry,Chenyu Hou,Franck Portier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,E31,E43,E52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Innovation-Led Transitions in Energy Supply,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Generalizing models of directed technical change, I show that complementarities between innovations and factors of production (here, energy resources) can drive transitions away from a dominant sector. In a calibrated numerical implementation, the economy gradually transitions energy supply from coal to gas and then to renewable energy, even in the absence of policy. The welfare-maximizing tax on carbon emissions is J-shaped, immediately redirects most research to renewables, and rapidly transitions energy supply directly to renewables. The emission tax is twice as valuable as either the welfare-maximizing research subsidy or the welfare-maximizing mandate to use renewable resources.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20200369,Derek Lemoine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,H23,O31,O33,Q35,Q41,Q54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Impact of Extending Employment Protection to Agency Workers on Firms,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We study the impact of a reform that extended employment protection to temporary agency workers. Using a difference-in-difference research design, we show that plants more exposed to the regulation experienced a decrease in revenues and total employment, and that the latter effect was attenuated in industries with high elasticity of substitution between agency and nonagency workers. We also find that labor misallocation increased as a consequence of the regulation. A model of labor demand in the presence of agency work rationalizes these results.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20210249,Alejandro Micco,Pablo Muñoz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J22,J23,J31,K31,L60,M51,O15,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Immigrant Communities and Knowledge Spillovers: Danish Americans and the Development of the Dairy Industry in the United States,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Despite the growing literature on the impact of immigration, little is known about the role existing migrant settlements can play for knowledge transmission and the location of industry. We present a case that can illustrate this important mechanism and hypothesize that nineteenth-century Danish American communities helped spread knowledge on modern dairying to rural America. From around 1880 Denmark developed rapidly, and by 1890 it was a world-leading dairy producer. Using a difference-in-differences strategy and data taken from the US census and Danish emigration archives, we find that counties with more Danes in 1880 subsequently both specialized in dairying and used more modern practices.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20210074,Nina Boberg-Fazlić,Paul Sharp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J15,J61,L66,N31,N51,O33,Q12,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wage Rigidity and Employment Outcomes: Evidence from Administrative Data,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper examines the relationship between downward nominal wage rigidity and employment outcomes using linked employer-employee data. Wage rigidity prevents 27.1 percent of counterfactual wage cuts, with a standard deviation of 19.2 percent across establishments. An establishment with the sample-average level of wage rigidity is predicted to have a 3.3 percentage point higher layoff rate, a 7.4 percentage point lower quit rate, and a 2.0 percentage point lower hire rate. Estimating a structural model by indirect inference implies that the cost of a nominal wage cut is 33 percent of an average worker's annual compensation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20200125,Gabriel Ehrlich,Joshua Montes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,J23,J31,J63,M51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Homeownership and Portfolio Choice over the Generations,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Earnings are riskier and more unequal for households born in the 1960s and 1980s than for those born in the 1940s. Despite improvements in financial conditions, younger generations are less likely to be living in their own homes than older generations at the same age. By using a life cycle model with housing and portfolio choice that includes flexible earnings risk and aggregate asset price risk, I show that changes in earnings dynamics account for a large part of the reduction in homeownership across generations.

A Congestion Theory of Unemployment Fluctuations,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We propose a theory of unemployment fluctuations in which new hires and incumbent workers are imperfect substitutes. Hence, attempts to hire away the unemployed during recessions diminish the marginal product of new hires, discouraging job creation. This single feature achieves a tenfold increase in the volatility of hiring in an otherwise standard search model, produces a realistic Beveridge curve despite countercyclical separations, and explains 30–40 percent of US unemployment fluctuations. Additionally, it explains the excess procyclicality of new hires' wages, the cyclical labor wedge, countercyclical earnings losses from job displacement, and the limited steady-state effects of unemployment insurance.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20210171,Yusuf Mercan,Benjamin Schoefer,Petr Sedláček,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,E32,J22,J23,J31,J63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scarred Consumption,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We show that prior lifetime experiences can ""scar"" consumers. Consumers who have lived through times of unemployment exhibit persistent pessimism about their future financial situation and spend significantly less years later, controlling for income, employment, and other life-cycle consumption factors. Due to their experience-induced frugality, scarred consumers build up more wealth.

Firms' Precautionary Savings and Employment during a Credit Crisis,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Can the macroeconomic effects of credit supply shocks be large even when a small share of firms is credit constrained? I use UK firm-level accounting data to discipline a heterogeneous-firm model where the interaction between real and financial frictions induces precautionary cash holdings. In the data, firms increased their cash ratios during the Great Recession, and cash-intensive firms displayed higher employment growth. A tightening of firms' credit conditions generates the same dynamics in the model.

Assessing the Stabilizing Effects of Unemployment Benefit Extensions,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We study the stabilizing role of benefit extensions. We develop a tractable quantitative model with heterogeneous agents, search frictions, and nominal rigidities. The model allows for a stabilizing aggregate demand channel and a destabilizing labor market channel. We characterize each channel analytically and find that aggregate demand effects quantitatively prevail in the United States. When feeding in estimated shocks, the model tracks unemployment in the two most recent downturns.

Adverse Selection Dynamics in Privately Produced Safe Debt Markets,"VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2024",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Privately produced safe debt is designed so that there is no adverse selection in trade. But in some macro states—here, the onset of the pandemic—it becomes profitable for some agents to produce private information, and then agents face adverse selection when they trade the debt (i.e., it becomes information sensitive). We empirically study these adverse selection dynamics in a very important asset class, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which finance loans to below-investment-grade firms.

Using theory and direct survey evidence, we argue that three-quarters of this increase reflects the adoption of new work arrangements that will likely be permanent for many workers. A quantitative model matched to survey data predicts that twice as many workers will WFH full-time postpandemic compared to prepandemic, and that one in every five instead of seven workdays will be WFH.

Electricity and Firm Productivity: A General-Equilibrium Approach,"VOL. 15, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Many policymakers view power outages as a major constraint on firm productivity in developing countries. Yet empirical studies find modest short-run effects of outages on firm performance. This paper builds a dynamic macroeconomic model to study the long-run general-equilibrium effects of power outages on productivity. Outages lower productivity in the model by creating idle resources, depressing the scale of incumbent firms and reducing entry of new firms. Consistent with the empirical literature, the model predicts small short-run effects of eliminating outages.

The discretionary monetary policy is procyclical to mitigate balance sheet effects originating from exchange rate depreciations during sudden stops. Committing to an inflation targeting regime is found to increase social welfare and reduce the frequency of financial crises despite increasing their severity.

The durable subsidy is driven by the life-cycle features of the model together with durables' irreversibility and borrowing constraints. Uniform taxation on nondurables holds under exogenous and endogenous—fully or weakly separable—labor supply and it relies on homogeneity of intertemporal preferences.

Insurance benefits are larger for UI recipients who are predominantly wealth poor.

Firm Wages in a Frictional Labor Market,"VOL. 15, NO. 1, JANUARY 2023",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper studies wage setting in a directed search model of multiworker firms facing within-firm equity constraints on wages. The constraints reduce wages, as firms exploit their monopsony power over their existing workers, rendering wages less responsive to productivity in doing so. They also give rise to a time inconsistency in the dynamic firm problem, as firms face a less elastic labor supply in the short run than in the long run, making commitment to future wages valuable. Constrained firms find it profitable to fix wages, and doing so is good for worker welfare and resource allocation in equilibrium.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20200440,Leena Rudanko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,E32,J31,J42,J63,J64,M52,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How Wage Announcements Affect Job Search—A Field Experiment,"VOL. 14, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"In a field experiment, we study how job seekers respond to posted wages by assigning wages randomly to pairs of otherwise similar vacancies in a large number of professions. Higher wages attract significantly more interest. Still, a nontrivial number of applicants only reveal an interest in the low-wage vacancy. With a complementary survey, we show that external raters perceive higher-wage jobs as more competitive. These findings qualitatively support core predictions of theories of directed/competitive search, though in the simplest calibrated model, applications react too strongly to the wage.

By inducing a lower interest rate, public savings slow consumption and leisure growth over an average household's lifetime, and the resulting flatter allocation of lifetime consumption and leisure improves welfare.

This intertemporal trade-off for loose financial conditions is amplified when credit-to-GDP growth is rapid.

Sectoral Heterogeneity and Monetary Policy,"VOL. 14, NO. 2, APRIL 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Since sectors differ in their sensitivity to interest rates, monetary policy produces inefficient sectoral fluctuations. In a model with sectoral heterogeneity, I show that policymakers should weight sectors proportionally to their interest elasticities, account for dynamic demand effects from durable goods, and systematically utilize forward guidance to reduce sectoral volatility. A calibrated model confirms these recommendations and finds that neglecting sectoral volatility produces substantial welfare losses.

Asset Price Booms and Macroeconomic Policy: A Risk-Shifting Approach,"VOL. 14, NO. 2, APRIL 2022",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper uses a risk-shifting model to analyze policy responses to asset price booms. We show risk shifting leads to inefficient asset and credit booms in which asset prices can exceed fundamentals. However, the inefficiencies associated with risk shifting arise independently of whether the asset is a bubble. Given evidence of risk shifting, policymakers may not need to determine if assets are bubbles to justify intervention. We then show that some of the main candidate interventions against asset booms have ambiguous welfare implications: tighter monetary policy can mitigate some inefficiencies but at a cost, while leverage restrictions may raise asset prices and lead to more leveraged speculation rather than less. Policy responses are more effective when they disproportionately discourage riskier investments.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20200041,Franklin Allen,Gadi Barlevy,Douglas Gale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D82,E23,E32,E44,E52,G01,G12,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then we develop a model of how this reduction in competition affects aggregate income. We apply our approach to the well-known special economic zones (SEZs) of China. We estimate that firms in SEZs exhibit cooperative pricing almost three times as intensively as firms outside SEZs. Nevertheless, we model the aggregate consequences of SEZs and find positive effects because markups become higher but also more equal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180443,Wyatt J.

Higher Taxes at the Top: The Role of Entrepreneurs,"VOL. 13, NO. 3, JULY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper computes optimal top marginal tax rates in Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari–type economies that include entrepreneurs.

The top marginal tax rate that maximizes welfare is 60 percent. While average welfare gains are positive and similar across occupations along the transition, they are larger for entrepreneurs than for workers in the long run, and this occupational gap in welfare gains after the tax increase widens with increasing income.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170441,Bettina Brüggemann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D11,D21,D31,H21,H24,L26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key to this result is that inflation has a small effect on resource misallocation when the model features firm-level shocks, which are necessary to match the empirical distribution of price changes. A higher inflation target decreases price flexibility at the zero lower bound, and through this mechanism, it reduces the severity of recessions when the monetary authority is constrained.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180198,Andrés Blanco,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E12,E31,E32,E42,E52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shopping for Lower Sales Tax Rates,"VOL. 13, NO. 3, JULY 2021",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Using comprehensive high-frequency state and local sales tax data, we show that shopping behavior responds strongly to changes in sales tax rates. Even though sales taxes are not observed in posted prices and have a wide range of rates and exemptions, consumers adjust in many dimensions. They stock up on storable goods before taxes rise and increase online and cross-border shopping in both the short and long run. The difference between short- and long-run spending responses has important implications for the efficacy of using sales taxes for countercyclical policy and for the design of an optimal tax framework. Interestingly, households adjust spending similarly for both taxable and tax-exempt goods. We embed an inventory problem into a continuous-time consumption-savings model and demonstrate that this behavior is optimal in the presence of shopping trip fixed costs. The model successfully matches estimated short-run and long-run tax elasticities.

In the model, 35 percent of male and 18 percent of female permanent wage shocks pass through to consumption, compared to the empirical estimates of 32 percent and 19 percent. Most of the consumption insurance against permanent male wage shocks is provided through the presence and labor supply response of the female earner. Abstracting from this private intrahousehold income insurance mechanism strongly biases upward the welfare losses from idiosyncratic wage risk as well as the desired extent of public insurance through progressive income taxation.

Land Reform and Productivity: A Quantitative Analysis with Micro Data,"VOL. 12, NO. 3, JULY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We assess the effects of a major land policy change on farm size and agricultural productivity using a quantitative model and micro-level data. We study the 1988 land reform in the Philippines that imposed a ceiling on land holdings, redistributed above-ceiling lands to landless and smallholder households, and severely restricted the transferability of the redistributed farmlands. We study this reform in the context of an industry model of agriculture with a nondegenerate distribution of farm sizes featuring an occupation decision and a technology choice of farm operators. In this model, the land reform can reduce agricultural productivity not only by misallocating resources across farmers but also by distorting farmers' occupation and technology decisions. The model, calibrated to prereform farm-level data in the Philippines, implies that on impact, the land reform reduces average farm size by 34 percent and agricultural productivity by 17 percent. The government assignment of land and the ban on its transfer are key for the magnitude of the results since a market allocation of the above-ceiling land produces about one-third of the size and productivity effects.

In this economy greater unemployment risk raises desired savings, causing aggregate demand to fall and feed back to greater unemployment risk. This deflationary spiral is constrained inefficient and calls for an accommodative monetary policy response: after a contractionary aggregate shock the policy rate should be kept significantly lower and for longer than in the perfect-insurance benchmark. For example, the usual prescription obtained under perfect insurance of a hike in the policy rate in the face of a bad supply (i.e., productivity or cost-push) shock is easily overturned. The optimal policy breaks the deflationary spiral and takes the dynamics of the imperfect-insurance economy close to that of the perfect-insurance benchmark.

Older Americans Would Work Longer If Jobs Were Flexible,"VOL. 12, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Older Americans, even those who are long retired, have strong willingness to work, especially in jobs with flexible schedules. For many, labor force participation near or after normal retirement age is limited more by a lack of acceptable job opportunities or low expectations about finding them than by unwillingness to work longer. This paper establishes these findings using an approach to identification based on strategic survey questions (SSQs), purposefully designed to complement behavioral data. These findings suggest that demand-side factors are important in explaining late-in-life labor market behavior and need to be considered in designing policies aimed at promoting working longer.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170403,John Ameriks,Joseph Briggs,Andrew Caplin,Minjoon Lee,Matthew D.

Multidimensional Skill Mismatch,"VOL. 12, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"What determines the earnings of a worker relative to his peers in the same occupation? What makes a worker fail in one occupation but succeed in another? More broadly, what are the factors that determine the productivity of a worker-occupation match? To help answer questions like these, we propose an empirical measure of multidimensional skill mismatch that is based on the discrepancy between the portfolio of skills required by an occupation and the portfolio of abilities possessed by a worker for learning those skills. This measure arises naturally in a dynamic model of occupational choice and human capital accumulation with multidimensional skills and Bayesian learning about one's ability to learn skills. Not only does mismatch depress wage growth in the current occupation, it also leaves a scarring effect—by stunting skill acquisition—that reduces wages in future occupations. Mismatch also predicts different aspects of occupational switching behavior. We construct the empirical analog of our skill mismatch measure from readily available US panel data on individuals and occupations and find empirical support for these implications. The magnitudes of these effects are large: moving from the worst- to the best-matched decile can improve wages by 11 percent per year for the rest of one's career.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160241,Fatih Guvenen,Burhan Kuruscu,Satoshi Tanaka,David Wiczer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E24,J24,J31,J41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leverage and Deepening Business-Cycle Skewness,"VOL. 12, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We document that the United States and other G7 economies have been characterized by an increasingly negative business-cycle asymmetry over the last three decades. This finding can be explained by the concurrent increase in the financial leverage of households and firms. To support this view, we devise and estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model with collateralized borrowing and occasionally binding credit constraints. Improved access to credit increases the likelihood that financial constraints become nonbinding in the face of expansionary shocks, allowing agents to freely substitute intertemporally. Contractionary shocks, however, are further amplified by drops in collateral values, since constraints remain binding. As a result, booms become progressively smoother and more prolonged than busts. Finally, in line with recent empirical evidence, financially driven expansions lead to deeper contractions, as compared with equally-sized nonfinancial expansions.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170319,Henrik Jensen,Ivan Petrella,Søren Hove Ravn,Emiliano Santoro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D14,E23,E32,E44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model allows us to examine the transition from ""normal"" states to systemic risk states. We calibrate our model and use it to match the systemic risk apparent during the 2007/2008 financial crisis.

In the model, a welfare-maximizing monetary policy rule features a strong response to output, and the welfare gain from output stabilization is much larger than when TFP expands exogenously.

Some Evidence on Secular Drivers of US Safe Real Rates,"VOL. 11, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We study long-run correlations between safe real interest rates in the United States and over 30 variables that have been hypothesized to influence real rates. The list of variables is motivated by an intertermporal IS equation, by models of aggregate savings and investment, and by reduced-form studies. We use annual data, mostly from 1890 to 2016. We find that safe real interest rates are correlated as expected with demographic measures. For example, the long-run correlation with labor force hours growth is positive, which is consistent with overlapping generations models. For another example, the long-run correlation with the proportion of 40 to 64 year-olds in the population is negative. This is consistent with standard theory where middle-aged workers are high savers who drive down real interest rates. In contrast to standard theory, we do not find productivity to be positively correlated with real rates. Most other variables have a mixed relationship with the real rate, with long-run correlations that are statistically or economically large in some samples and by some measures but not in others.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180005,Kurt G.

Unemployment Cycles,"VOL. 11, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"The labor market by itself can create cyclical outcomes, even in the absence of exogenous shocks. We propose a theory in which the search behavior of the employed has profound aggregate implications for the unemployed. There is a strategic complementarity between active on-the-job search and vacancy posting by firms, which leads to multiple equilibria: in the presence of sorting, active on-the-job search improves the quality of the pool of searchers. This encourages vacancy posting, which in turn makes costly on-the-job search more attractive—a self-fulfilling equilibrium. The model provides a rationale for the Jobless Recovery, the outward shift of the Beveridge curve during the boom and for pro-cyclical frictional wage dispersion. Central to the model's mechanism is the fact that the employed crowd out the unemployed when on-the-job search picks up during recovery.

I show that a model of firm dynamics with incremental innovation cannot explain this evidence. However, further including radical innovation, which is very risky but potentially very productive, allows for the joint replication of several stylized facts about the dynamics of young and old firms and the differences in productivity growth in industries with different degrees of financing frictions. These frictions matter because they act as a barrier to entry that reduces competition and the risk-taking of young firms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160298,Andrea Caggese,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D22,D24,D25,G32,L25,L60,O31,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use an assignment framework with many labor groups, equipment types, and occupations in which changes in inequality are driven by changes in workforce composition, occupation demand, computerization, and labor productivity. We parameterize the model using direct measures of computer usage within labor group-occupation pairs and quantify the impact of each shock for various dimensions of between-group inequality between 1984 and 2003. We find, for example, that computerization and shifts in occupation demand jointly account for roughly 80 percent of the rise in the skill premium, with computerization alone accounting for roughly 60 percent. In an open-economy extension of the model, we show how computerization and changes in occupation demand can be caused by changes in the extent of international trade and perform counterfactual exercises to quantify these effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170291,Ariel Burstein,Eduardo Morales,Jonathan Vogel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D63,J16,J22,J23,J24,J31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimal policy prescribes higher taxes in adverse times and front-loaded fiscal consolidations that lead to a balanced primary budget in the long-run.

The Urban Mortality Transition and Poor-Country Urbanization,"VOL. 11, NO. 1, JANUARY 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Today the world's fastest-growing cities lie in low-income countries, unlike the historical norm. Also unlike the ""killer cities"" of history, cities in low-income countries grow not just through in-migration but also through their own natural increase. First, we use novel historical data to document that many poor countries urbanized at the same time as the postwar urban mortality transition. Second, we develop a framework incorporating location choice with heterogeneity in demographics and congestion costs across locations to account for this. In the framework, people prefer to live in low-mortality locations, and the aggregate rate of population growth and the locational choice of individuals interact. Third, we calibrate this to data from a sample of poor countries, and find that informal urban areas (e.g. slums) can absorb additional population more easily than other locations. We show that between 1950 and 2005 the urban mortality transition could have doubled the urbanization rate as well as the size of informal urban areas in this sample. Of these effects, one-third could be attributed to the amenity effect of lower urban mortality rates, while the remainder is due to higher population growth disproportionately pushing people into informal urban areas. Fourth, simulations suggest that family planning programs, as well as industrialization or urban infrastructure and institutions may be effective in slowing poor-country urbanization.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170189,Remi Jedwab,Dietrich Vollrath,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I12,J11,N30,O15,O18,R11,R23,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Inventory Management, Product Quality, and Cross-Country Income Differences","VOL. 11, NO. 1, JANUARY 2019",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Previous research has documented that export shipments are ""lumpy""—exporters make infrequent and relatively large shipments to any given export destination. This fact has been interpreted as implying that fixed, per shipment cost and inventory management decisions play a key role in international trade. We document here that exports from poor countries are considerably more lumpy—have higher fixed per shipment cost—than those from rich countries. Using a model of trade with inventory management, we estimate that the country at the ninetieth percentile of the distribution of per shipment costs has almost three times higher costs than the one at the tenth percentile. We show that these per shipment cost differences have a reduced-form representation given by an ad valorem trade cost that varies with export country income (as in Waugh 2010). A calibrated version of the model that incorporates these estimates and allows for endogenous product quality reveals that cross-country differences in per shipment costs explain almost 40 percent of the observed cross-country differences in income. It also shows that policies that lower per shipment costs can lead to significant welfare gains, mainly due to induced quality upgrading.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170080,Bernardo S.

We propose a model of firm dynamics featuring entry, exit, and multiproduct firms to understand the contribution of these dynamic factors in shaping the welfare and long-run productivity gains from removing distortions.

Investment Hangover and the Great Recession,"VOL. 10, NO. 2, APRIL 2018",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We present a model of investment hangover motivated by the Great Recession. Overbuilding of durable capital such as housing requires a reallocation of productive resources to other sectors, which is facilitated by a reduction in the interest rate. When monetary policy is constrained, overbuilding induces a demand-driven recession with limited reallocation and low output. Investment in other capital initially declines due to low demand, but it later booms and induces an asymmetric recovery in which the overbuilt sector is left behind. Welfare can be improved by ex post policies that stimulate investment (including in overbuilt capital) and ex ante policies that restrict investment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160211,Matthew Rognlie,Andrei Shleifer,Alp Simsek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E22,E23,E32,E43,E52,R21,R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We construct a dynamic model of housing, consumption, employment, and relocation, which provides a structural interpretation of our empirical results and allows us to explore the role that foreclosure played in labor mobility. We find that negative home equity is not a significant barrier to job-related mobility because the benefits of accepting an out-of-area job outweigh the costs of moving. This pattern holds even if homeowners are not able to default on their mortgages.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20130326,Yuliya Demyanyk,Dmytro Hryshko,María Jose Luengo-Prado,Bent E.

A shock worsening the liquidity properties of the pseudo-safe assets raises interest rate spreads and can cause a deep recession-cum-deflation. Expanding the central bank's balance sheet fills the shortage of safe assets and counteracts the recession. Lowering the interest rate on reserves insulates market interest rates from the liquidity shock and improves risk sharing between borrowers and savers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150073,Pierpaolo Benigno,Salvatore Nisticò,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E31,E32,E43,E44,E52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Credit Relationships and Business Bankruptcy during the Great Depression,"VOL. 9, NO. 2, APRIL 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Credit relationships are sticky. Stickiness makes relationships beneficial to borrowers in times of their own distress but makes them potentially problematic when lenders themselves face hardship. To examine the role of credit relationships during a financial crisis, we exploit a natural experiment in Mississippi during the Great Depression that generated plausibly exogenous differences in financial distress for banks. Using new data drawn from the publications of the credit rating agency Dun & Bradstreet and from original bankruptcy filings, we show that financial distress increased business exit but did not increase the bankruptcy rate. Financial distress caused both banks and trade creditors to recalibrate their collections strategies, which is revealed by changes in the geographical distribution of the creditors of bankrupt businesses.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150218,Mary Eschelbach Hansen,Nicolas L.

However, currencies can be counterfeited at a fixed cost and the decision to counterfeit is private information. This induces equilibrium liquidity constraints on the currencies in circulation.

Growth-Rate and Uncertainty Shocks in Consumption: Cross-Country Evidence,"VOL. 9, NO. 1, JANUARY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We provide new estimates of the importance of growth-rate shocks and uncertainty shocks for developed countries. The shocks we estimate are large and correspond to well-known macroeconomic episodes such as the Great Moderation and the productivity slowdown.

Our estimates yield greater return predictability and a more volatile price-dividend ratio. In addition, we can explain a substantial fraction of cross-country variation in the equity premium. An advantage of our approach, based on macroeconomic data alone, is that the parameter estimates cannot be viewed as backward engineered to fit asset pricing data.

This holds true even if default generates significant deadweight costs ex post.

First, the estimated segmentation coefficient implies a nontrivial effect of central bank asset purchases on yields and real activity. Second, there are welfare gains to having the central bank respond to the term premium, e.g., including the term premium in the Taylor Rule. Third, a policy that directly targets the term premium sterilizes the real economy from shocks originating in the financial sector.

Trying to Understand the PPPs in ICP 2011: Why Are the Results So Different?,"VOL. 9, NO. 1, JANUARY 2017",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Purchasing power parity exchange rates, or PPPs, are price indexes that summarize prices in each country relative to a numeraire country, typically the United States. These numbers are used to compare living standards across countries, by academics in studies of economic growth, particularly through the Penn World Table, by the World Bank to construct measures of global poverty, by the European Union to redistribute resources, and by the international development community to draw attention to discrepancies between rich and poor countries. The International Comparison Program (ICP) collects the detailed prices on which these indexes are based on an irregular basis. In 2014, the ICP published PPPs from the 2011 round that are sharply different from those that were expected from extrapolation of the previous round, ICP 2005. These discrepancies will eventually have important implications for the Penn World Table, and for international comparisons of living standards given that the PPPs are used to convert countries' national accounts--GDP and consumption, for example--from local currency to common currency units (international dollars.) The world according to ICP 2011 looks markedly more equal than the world according to ICP 2005. This paper investigates why this happened. We identify a likely source of the problem in the way that the regions of the ICP were linked in 2005. We use two different methods for measuring the size of the effect. Both suggest that the 2005 PPPs for consumption for countries in Asia (excluding Japan), Western Asia, and Africa were overstated relative to the United States by between 18 to 26 percent. Per capita consumption in international dollars of these countries was therefore too low in 2005 and more likely to be accurately estimated in 2011.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150153,Angus Deaton,Bettina Aten,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E31,F31,I31,I32,O11,O19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of monetary policy are less powerful in recessions, especially for durables expenditure and business investment. The asymmetry relates to how fast the economy is growing, rather than to the level of resource utilization. There is some evidence that fiscal policy has counteracted monetary policy in recessions but reinforced it in booms. We also find evidence that contractionary policy shocks are more powerful than expansionary shocks, but contractionary shocks have not been more common in booms.

In the model, banks borrow (use leverage) to allocate resources to productive projects and provide liquidity. When banks do not actively issue new equity, aggregate outcomes depend on the level of equity in the financial sector. Equilibrium is inefficient because agents do not internalize how their decisions affect volatility, aggregate leverage, and the returns on assets. Leverage creates systemic risk, which increases the frequency and duration of crises. Limiting leverage decreases asset price volatility and increases expected returns, which decrease the likelihood that the financial sector is undercapitalized.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20140233,Gregory Phelan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E32,E44,G01,G21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, under unfettered liberalization that also allows uncollateralized option-like liabilities, discipline breaks down, and efficiency falls.

A Road Map for Efficiently Taxing Heterogeneous Agents,"VOL. 8, NO. 2, APRIL 2016",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper characterizes optimal labor income taxes that depend on age, household assets, and filing status (one or two earners) within a life-cycle model with heterogeneous, two-member households. The key innovation is a labor supply elasticity that varies endogenously among households. I find that tax distortions should be hump shaped in age, decrease in household assets, and be lower for joint relative to single filers. Age and assets act as complements within the optimal tax policy. Overall, a tax system using all three tags can increase consumption up to 6.4 percent and welfare up to 1.5 percent.

It is assumed that claims held on intermediaries cannot be fully enforced such that intermediation is subject to intermediary equity requirements.

Specifically, a constrained social planner can achieve a Pareto improvement by creating long-term rents for intermediaries, which immediately reduces intermediary equity requirements. The constrained-efficient allocation can be implemented by a positive tax on future intermediary activity.

Optimal Mirrleesean Taxation in a Ben-Porath Economy,"VOL. 7, NO. 2, APRIL 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"I characterize optimal taxes in a life-cycle economy where ability and human capital are unobservable. I show that unobservable human capital effectively makes preferences over labor nonseparable across age. I generalize the static optimal tax formulas to account for such nonseparabilities and show how they depend both on own-Frisch labor elasticities and cross-Frisch labor elasticities. I calibrate the economy to US data. I find that the optimal marginal income taxes decrease with age, in contrast to both the US tax code and to a model with observable human capital. I demonstrate that the behavior of cross Frisch elasticities is essential in explaining the decline.

Unemployment Insurance Fraud and Optimal Monitoring,"VOL. 7, NO. 2, APRIL 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,An important incentive problem for the design of unemployment insurance is the fraudulent collection of unemployment benefits by workers who are gainfully employed. We show how to efficiently use a combination of tax/subsidy and monitoring to prevent such fraud. The optimal policy monitors the unemployed at fixed intervals. Employment tax is nonmonotonic: it increases between verifications but decreases after a verification. Unemployment benefits are relatively flat between verifications but decrease sharply after a verification. Our quantitative analysis suggests that the optimal monitoring cost is 60 percent of the cost in the current US system. ,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20130255,David L. Fuller,B.

Conventional and Unconventional Monetary Policy with Endogenous Collateral Constraints,"VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2015",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We consider the effects of central bank purchases of a risky asset as an additional dimension of policy alongside ""conventional"" interest rate policy in a general-equilibrium model of asset pricing with endogenous collateral constraints. The effects of asset purchases depend on the way that they affect collateral constraints. We show that under some circumstances, central bank purchases relax financial constraints, increase aggregate demand, and may even achieve a Pareto improvement; but in other cases, they tighten financial constraints, reduce aggregate demand, and lower welfare. The latter case is almost certainly the one that arises if central bank purchases are sufficiently large.

We reach this conclusion by looking through the lens of an estimated New Keynesian model in which firms face moderate degrees of price rigidities, no nominal rigidities in wages, and a binding zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate. Our model does a good job of accounting for the joint behavior of labor and goods markets, as well as inflation, during the Great Recession. According to the model the observed fall in total factor productivity and the rise in the cost of working capital played critical roles in accounting for the small drop in inflation that occurred during the Great Recession.

Estimating Models with Dispersed Information,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, JANUARY 2014",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,We conduct likelihood evaluation of a DSGE model in which firms have imperfect common knowledge. Imperfect common knowledge is found to be more successful than price stickiness á la Calvo to account for the highly persistent effects of nominal shocks on output and inflation. Our likelihood analysis suggests that firms pay little attention to aggregate nominal conditions. This paper shows that such allocation of attention is plausible because it is optimal for firms with a reasonably small size of information frictions and a size of idiosyncratic uncertainty that is in line with the micro evidence on price changes.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.6.1.1,Leonardo Melosi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C51,D83,E13,E23,E31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Credit Constraints and Self-Fulfilling Business Cycles,"VOL. 6, NO. 1, JANUARY 2014",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We argue that credit constraints not only amplify fundamental shocks, they can also lead to self-fulfilling business cycles. We study a model with heterogeneous firms, in which imperfect contract enforcement implies that productive firms face binding credit constraints, with the borrowing capacity limited by expected equity value. A drop in equity value tightens credit constraints and reallocates resources from productive to unproductive firms. Such reallocation reduces aggregate productivity, further depresses equity value, generating a financial multiplier. Aggregate dynamics are isomorphic to those in a representative-agent economy with increasing returns. For sufficiently tight credit constraints, the model generates self-fulfilling business cycles.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.6.1.32,Zheng Liu,Pengfei Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E13,E32,E44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing public employment stimulates labor demand, which increases tightness and therefore crowds out private employment. Critically, the quasi-labor supply is convex.

Method of moments estimation shows how measurement error in consumption eliminates excessive skewness and smoothness of consumption growth.

Our findings indicate that the size of capital injections relative to the initial financial condition of banks is crucial for the success of bank bailouts. Capital injections that are large enough to reestablish bank capital requirements increase the supply of credit and spur investment. In contrast, not only do capital injections that are too small fail to increase the supply of credit, but they also encourage the evergreening of nonperforming loans.

A third of the respondents reported bargaining over pay before accepting their current jobs. Almost a third of workers had precise information about pay when they first met with their employers, a sign of wage posting. About 40 percent of workers were on-the-job searchers—they could have remained at their earlier jobs at the time they accepted their current jobs, indicating a more favorable bargaining position than is held by unemployed job-seekers.

The model with a constant separation rate fails to produce realistic volatility and productivity responsiveness of the separation rate and worker flows. The specification with endogenous separation succeeds along these dimensions. Allowing for on-the-job search enables the model to replicate the Beveridge curve. All specifications, however, fail to generate sufficient volatility of the job finding rate. While adopting the Hagedorn-Manovskii calibration remedies this problem, the volume of job-to-job transitions in the on-the-job search specification becomes essentially zero.

Political considerations contributed to delays in monetary tightening, insufficiently aggressive anti-inflation policies, and the premature abandonment of attempts at disinflation.

We attribute the disparities to the countries' tax and subsidy policies. High taxation substantially reduces hours in sectors that have close home substitutes but less so in other sectors. Subsidies increase hours in the subsidized sectors that have home substitutes. We compute these policy effects for 19 OECD countries. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.3.4.1,L.

Exchange Rates and Wages in an Integrated World,"VOL. 3, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2011",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We analyze how the pass-through from exchange rate to domestic wages depends on the degree of integration between domestic and foreign labor markets. Using data from 66 countries over the period 1981-2005, we find that the elasticity of domestic wages to real exchange rate is 0.15 after a year for countries with high barriers to external labor mobility, but about 0.40 in countries with low barriers to mobility. The result is robust to the inclusion of various controls, different measures of exchange rates, and definitions of labor market integration.

We consider a simple model where firms are subject to shocks which may force them to default on their debt. Firms' assets and liabilities are nominal and predetermined. Monetary policy can therefore affect the real value of funds used to finance production. In this model, allowing for inflation volatility in response to aggregate shocks can be optimal; the optimal response to adverse financial shocks is to lower interest rates and to engineer some inflation; and the Taylor rule may implement allocations that have opposite cyclical properties to the optimal ones.

It is also shown that technological improvement of inventory management can increase, rather than decrease, the volatility of aggregate output. Key to this seemingly counterintuitive result is that a stockout-avoidance motive leads to a procyclical shadow value of inventories, which acts as an automatic stabilizer that discourages sales in booms and encourages demand in recessions, thereby reducing the variability of GDP.

This paper returns to two old ideas: linkages and complementarity. First, linkages between firms through intermediate goods deliver a multiplier similar to the one associated with capital in a neoclassical growth model. Because the intermediate goods share of output is about one-half, this multiplier is substantial. Second, just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, problems along a production chain can sharply reduce output under complementarity. These forces considerably amplify distortions to the allocation of resources, bringing us closer to understanding large income differences across countries.(JEL: D57, E23, O1O, O47)",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.3.2.1,Charles I.

Do Output Contractions Trigger Democratic Change?,"VOL. 2, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Does faster economic growth increase pressure for democratic change, or reduce it? Using data for 154 countries for the period 1963-2007, we examine the short-run relationship between economic growth and moves toward and away from greater democracy. To address the potential endogeneity of economic growth, we use variation in precipitation, temperatures, and commodity prices as instruments for a country's rate of economic growth. Our results indicate that more rapid economic growth reduces the short-run likelihood of institutional change toward democracy. Output contractions due to adverse weather shocks appear to have a particularly important impact on the timing of democratic change. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.2.4.124,Paul J.

The Structure of Tariffs and Long-Term Growth,"VOL. 2, NO. 4, OCTOBER 2010",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We show that the ""skill bias"" of a country's tariff structure is positively correlated with long-term per capita GDP growth. Testing for causal mechanisms, we find evidence consistent with the existence of real benefits from tariffs focused in skill-intensive industries. However, this only accounts for a quarter of the total correlation between skill-biased tariffs and growth. Turning to alternative explanations, we extend the standard Grossman-Helpman ""protection-for- sale"" model and show how the skill bias of tariffs can reflect the extent of domestic rent-seeking activities in the economy. We provide evidence that the remaining variation is explained by this endogeneity.

In the model, the credit method used to collect value-added tax (VAT) creates informality chains-clients or suppliers of informal firms are more likely to be informal.

Various empirical measures of formality of suppliers and buyers, and of enforcement downstream and upstream, are positively correlated with formality.

A parametric restriction yields the standard NKPC under constant elasticity and no role for foreign competition to influence domestic inflation. Foreign competition plays an important role in accounting for the behavior of traded goods price inflation.

Can a Representative-Agent Model Represent a Heterogeneous-Agent Economy,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Accounting for observed fluctuations in aggregate employment, consumption, and real wage using the optimality conditions of a representative household requires preferences that are incompatible with economic priors. In order to reconcile theory with data, we construct a model with heterogeneous agents whose decisions are difficult to aggregate because of incomplete capital markets and the indivisible nature of labor supply. If we were to explain the model-generated aggregate time series using decisions of a stand-in household, such a household must have a nonconcave or unstable utility as is often found with the aggregate US data.

Hit or Miss? The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"Assassinations are a persistent feature of the political landscape. Using a new dataset of assassination attempts on all world leaders from 1875 to 2004, we exploit inherent randomness in the success or failure of assassination attempts to identify the effects of assassination. We find that, on average, successful assassinations of autocrats produce sustained moves toward democracy. We also find that assassinations affect the intensity of small-scale conflicts. The results document a contemporary source of institutional change, inform theories of conflict, and show that small sources of randomness can have a pronounced effect on history.

Democratic Capital: The Nexus of Political and Economic Change,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We study the dynamics of economic and political change, theoretically and empirically. Democratic capital measured by a nation's historical experience with democracy, and the incidence of democracy in its neighborhood, appears to reduce exit rates from democracy and raise exit rates from autocracy. Higher democratic capital stimulates growth by increasing the stability of democracies. Heterogeneous effects of democracy induce sorting of countries into political regimes, which helps explain systematic differences between democracies and autocracies. Our results suggest the possibility of a virtuous circle, where accumulation of physical and democratic capital reinforce each other, promoting economic development and consolidation of democracy.

Understanding the Forward Premium Puzzle: A Microstructure Approach,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"High interest rate currencies tend to appreciate relative to low interest rate currencies. We argue that adverse selection problems between participants in foreign exchange markets can account for this ""forward premium puzzle."" The key feature of our model is that the adverse selection problem facing market makers is worse when an agent wants to trade against a public information signal. So, when based on public information, the currency is expected to appreciate, there is more adverse selection associated with a sell order than with a buy order.

"The International Diversification Puzzle When Goods Prices Are Sticky: It's Really about Exchange-Rate Hedging, Not Equity Portfolios","VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper develops a two-country monetary DSGE model in which households choose a portfolio of home and foreign equities, and a forward position in foreign exchange. Some nominal goods prices are sticky. Trade in these assets achieves the same allocations as trade in a complete set of nominal state-contingent claims in our linearized model. When there is a high degree of price stickiness, we show that not much equity diversification is required to replicate the complete-markets equilibrium when agents are able to hedge foreign exchange risk sufficiently. Moreover, temporarily sticky nominal goods prices can have large effects on equity portfolios even when dividend processes are very persistent.

A Century of Work and Leisure,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We develop comprehensive measures of time spent in market work, home production, schooling, and leisure in the United States for the last 106 years. We find that hours of work for prime age individuals are essentially unchanged, with the rise in women's hours fully compensating for the decline in men's hours. Hours worked by those 14 to 24 years old have declined noticeably, but most of this decline was offset by a rise in hours spent in school. Overall, per capita leisure and average annual lifetime leisure increased by only four or five hours per week during the last 100 years.

How Is Foreign Aid Spent? Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"VOL. 1, NO. 2, JULY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We use oil price fluctuations to test the impact of transfers from wealthy OPEC nations to their poorer Muslim allies. The instrument identifies plausibly exogenous variation in foreign aid. We investigate how aid is spent by tracking its short-run effect on aggregate demand, national accounts, and balance of payments. Aid affects most components of GDP though it has no statistically identifiable impact on prices or economic growth. Much aid is consumed, primarily in the form of imported noncapital goods. Aid substitutes for domestic savings, has no effect on the financial account, and leads to unaccounted capital flight. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.1.2.225,Eric Werker,Faisal Z.

Trade and the Diffusion of the Industrial Revolution,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"This paper proposes a model to describe the evolution of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the world economy that is intended to apply to all open economies. The parameters of the model are calibrated using evidence from Sachs and Warner on economies classed as open, from Parente and Prescott on economies that have successfully begun to develop, and from Kuznets and the World Bank on the employment share of agriculture in various times and places. The theory predicts convergence of the income levels and growth rates in the open economies and has strong but reasonable implications for transition dynamics.

On the Sources of the Great Moderation,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"The Great Moderation in the US economy has been accompanied by large changes in the comovements among output, hours, and labor productivity. Those changes are reflected in both conditional and unconditional second moments as well as in the impulse responses to identified shocks. Among other changes, our findings point to an increase in the volatility of hours relative to output, a shrinking contribution of nontechnology shocks to output volatility, and a change in the cyclical response of labor productivity to those shocks. That evidence suggests a more complex picture than that associated with ""good luck"" explanations of the Great Moderation.

A Black Swan in the Money Market,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"The recent financial crisis saw a dramatic and persistent jump in interest rate spreads between overnight federal funds and longer - term interbank loans. The Fed took several actions to reduce these spreads including the creation of the Term Auction Facility (TAF). The effectiveness of these policies depends on the cause of the increased spreads such as counterparty risk, liquidity, or other factors. Using a no-arbitrage pricing framework and various measures of risk, we find robust evidence that increased counterparty risk contributed to the rise in spreads but do not find robust evidence that the TAF had a significant effect on spreads.

The Ins and Outs of Cyclical Unemployment,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"A dominant trend in recent modeling of labor market fluctuations is to treat unemployment inflows as acyclical. This trend has been encouraged by recent influential papers that stress the role of longer unemployment spells, rather than more unemployment spells, in accounting for recessionary unemployment. After reviewing an empirical literature going back several decades, we apply a convenient log change decomposition to Current Population Survey data to characterize rising unemployment in each postwar recession. We conclude that a complete understanding of cyclical unemployment requires an explanation of countercyclical inflow rates, especially for job losers (layoffs), as well as procyclical outflow rates.

Civic Virtue and Labor Market Institutions,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"We argue civic virtue plays a key role in explaining the design of public insurance against unemployment risks by solving moral hazard issues which hinder the efficiency of unemployment insurance. We show, in a simple model, that economies with stronger civic virtues are more prone to provide insurance through unemployment benefits rather than through job protection. We provide cross-country empirical evidence of a strong correlation between civic attitudes and the design of unemployment benefits and employment protection in OECD countries over the period 1980 to 2003. We then use an epidemiological approach to estimate the existence of a potential causal relationship from inherited civic virtue to labor market insurance institutions.

Culture is proxied with past female labor force participation and total fertility rates from the woman's country of ancestry. The values of these variables capture not only economic and institutional conditions but also the country's preferences and beliefs regarding women's roles. Since the women live in the United States, only the belief and preference components are potentially relevant. We show that the cultural proxies have positive significant explanatory power even after controlling for education and spousal characteristics, and we demonstrate that the results are unlikely to be explained by unobserved human capital.

Rent Preservation and the Persistence of Underdevelopment,"VOL. 1, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009",AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: MACROECONOMICS,"When citizens in a poor constrained society are unequally endowed, they are likely to find it hard to agree on reforms, even though the status quo hurts them collectively. Each citizen group or constituency prefers reforms that expand its opportunities, but in an unequal society, this will typically hurt another constituency's rents. Competitive rent preservation ensures no comprehensive reform path may command broad support. The roots of underdevelopment may therefore lie in the natural tendency toward rent preservation in a divided society. ",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.1.1.178,Raghuram G.

Border Effect or Country Effect?

We argue that if there is cross-country heterogeneity in the distribution of within-country price differentials, there is no clear benchmark from which to gauge the effect of a border. In the absence of a structural model or a (natural) experiment, it is impossible to separate the ""border"" effect from the effect of trading with a country with a different distribution of prices. We show that the border effect identified by Engel and Rogers (1996) is entirely driven by the difference in the distribution of prices within the United States and Canada.

Our main disagreements today are about implementing the methodology. Some think New Keynesian models are ready to be used for quarter-to-quarter quantitative policy advice. We do not. Focusing on the state-of- the-art version of these models, we argue that some of its shocks and other features are not structural or consistent with microeconomic evidence. Since an accurate structural model is essential to reliably evaluate the effects of policies, we conclude that New Keynesian models are not yet useful for policy analysis.

According to competitive, market-clearing macroeconomic models, the ratio is easy to measure and should be equal to the sum of consumption and labor taxes. The observation that the wedge is higher in continental Europe than in the United States has proved useful for understanding the extent to which taxes can explain differences in labor market outcomes. The observation that the ratio rises during recessions suggests some failure of competitive, market-clearing macroeconomic models at business cycle frequencies. The latter observation has guided recent research, including work on sticky wage models and job search models.
