Mobilizing the Masses for Genocide,"Vol. 111, No. 1, January 2021",American Economic Review,"Do political elites use armed groups to foster civilian participation in genocidal violence? Are armed groups employed strategically? How do they mobilize civilians? I investigate these questions using data from the Rwandan Genocide. To establish causality, I exploit exogenous variation in armed groups' transport costs induced by weather fluctuations: the shortest distance of each village to the main road interacted with rainfall along the dirt tracks between main road and village. I find (i) 1 additional armed-group member resulted in 7.3 more civilian perpetrators; (ii) armed-group leaders employed their men strategically; and (iii) armed groups invoked civilians' obedience.",Thorsten Rogall,"<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160999"">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160999</a>"
Subsidy Policies and Insurance Demand,"Vol. 110, No. 8, August 2020",American Economic Review,"Using data from a two-year pricing experiment, we study the impact of subsidy policies on weather insurance take-up. Results show that subsidies increase future insurance take-up through their influence on payout experiences. Exploring mechanisms of the payout effect, we find that for households that randomly benefited from financial education, receiving a payout provides a one-time learning experience that improves take-up permanently. In contrast, households with poor insurance knowledge continuously update take-up decisions based on recent experiences with disasters and payouts. Combining subsidy policies with financial education can thus be effective in promoting long-run insurance adoption.",Jing Cai; Alain de Janvry; Elisabeth Sadoulet,"<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190661"">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190661</a>"
Validating Migration Responses to Flooding Using Satellite and Vital Registration Data,"Vol. 107, No. 5, May 2017",American Economic Review,"Rainfall measures may be imperfect proxies for floods, given factors such as upstream water balance, proximity to rivers, and topography. We check the robustness of flooding-migration relationships by combining nationally-representative survey data with measures of flooding derived from weather stations, gridded products, and remote sensing tools. Linear probability models reveal that extreme flooding is negatively associated with out-migration. Rainfall-based proxies produce results qualitatively similar to those using the satellite-based measure of inundation, but only the latter is able to discern non-monotonic effects throughout the distribution. Moreover, estimates differ widely across areas, suggesting that households respond differently to rainfall and flooding.",Joyce J.

Agricultural Productivity and Structural Transformation: Evidence from Brazil,"Vol. 106, No. 6, June 2016",American Economic Review,"We study the effects of the adoption of new agricultural technologies on structural transformation. To guide empirical work, we present a simple model where the effect of agricultural productivity on industrial development depends on the factor-bias of technical change. We test the predictions of the model by studying the introduction of genetically engineered soybean seeds in Brazil, which had heterogeneous effects on agricultural productivity across areas with different soil and weather characteristics. We find that technical change in soy production was strongly labor-saving and led to industrial growth, as predicted by the model.",Paula Bustos; Bruno Caprettini; Jacopo Ponticelli,"<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131061"">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20131061</a>"
Has the Increased Attachment of Women to the Labor Market Changed a Family's Ability to Smooth Income Shocks?,"Vol. 106, No. 5, May 2016",American Economic Review,"An increase in a married woman's attachment to the labor market affected her family's ability to smooth unexpected income shocks. Between 1970 and 1990, the sharp rise in labor market attachment provided an increasingly important channel for smoothing shocks to spousal income. As the participation rate stabilized, this contribution to smoothing evened out. In the Great Recession, both spouses received negative income shocks, and access to transfer income became the main insurance mechanism. Volatility of consumption followed volatility of family income trends but at a lower magnitude. Families' ability to weather income shocks didn't change during the 1970-2010 period.",Olga Gorbachev,"<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161119"">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161119</a>"
Are the Non-monetary Costs of Energy Efficiency Investments Large? Understanding Low Take-Up of a Free Energy Efficiency Program,"Vol. 105, No. 5, May 2015",American Economic Review,"We document very low take-up of an energy efficiency program that is widely believed to be privately beneficial. Program participants receive a substantial home ""weatherization"" retrofit; all installation and equipment costs are covered by the program. Less than 1 percent of presumptively eligible households take up the program in the control group. This rate increased only modestly after we took extraordinary efforts to inform households—via multiple channels—about the sizable benefits and zero monetary costs. These findings are consistent with high non-monetary costs associated with program participation and/or energy efficiency investments.",Meredith Fowlie; Michael Greenstone; Catherine Wolfram,"<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151011"">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151011</a>"
Tropical Economics,"Vol. 105, No. 5, May 2015",American Economic Review,"Why wealth is systematically lower in the tropics remains a puzzle. We point out that latitude may have fundamental economic consequence because it plays a key role in how countries experience geophysical processes that have economic implications. We demonstrate that annual fluctuations in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) leads to hotter and dryer local weather across tropical countries and subsequently to substantial losses in agricultural yields, output, and value-added. If volatility in agricultural production impedes economic growth, the relatively stronger influence of ENSO on the tropics may offer yet another partial explanation for slower historical growth in the tropics.",Solomon M.

"Rainfall Forecasts, Weather, and Wages over the Agricultural Production Cycle","Vol. 104, No. 5, May 2014",American Economic Review,"We look at the effects of rainfall forecasts and realized rainfall on equilibrium agricultural wages over the course of the agricultural production cycle. We show theoretically that a forecast of good weather can lower wages in the planting stage, by lowering ex ante out-migration, and can exacerbate the negative impact of adverse weather on harvest-stage wages. Using Indian household panel data describing early-season migration and district-level planting- and harvest-stage wages over the period 2005–2010, we find results consistent with the model, indicating that rainfall forecasts improve labor allocations on average but exacerbate wage volatility because they are imperfect.",Mark R.

Adaptation and Vertical Integration in the Airline Industry,"Vol. 99, No. 5, December 2009",American Economic Review,"We explore patterns of vertical integration in the US airline industry. Major airlines subcontract portions of their network to regional partners, which may or may not be owned. We investigate if ownership economizes on ex post renegotiation costs. We estimate whether airlines are more likely to use owned regionals on city pairs with adverse weather (which makes adaptation decisions more frequent) and on city pairs that are more integrated into the major's network (which raises the costs of having adaptation decisions resolved suboptimally). Our results suggest a robust empirical relationship between adaptation and vertical integration in this setting.

Women with 20 percent higher rainfall (relative to the local norm) are 0.57 centimeters taller, complete 0.22 more schooling grades, and live in households scoring 0.12 standard deviations higher on an asset index.

Projection Bias in Catalog Orders,"Vol. 97, No. 4, September 2007",American Economic Review,"Evidence suggests that people understand qualitatively how tastes change over time, but underestimate the magnitudes. This evidence is limited, however, to laboratory evidence or surveys of reported happiness. We test for such projection bias in field data. Using data on catalog orders of cold-weather items, we find evidence of projection bias over the weather—specifically, people's decisions are overinfluenced by the current weather. Our estimates suggest that if the order-date temperature declines by 30°F, the return probability increases by 3.95 percent. We also estimate a structural model to measure the magnitude of the bias.

The Economic Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Agricultural Output and Random Fluctuations in Weather,"Vol. 97, No. 1, March 2007",American Economic Review,"This paper measures the economic impact of climate change on US agricultural land by estimating the effect of random year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation on agricultural profits. The preferred estimates indicate that climate change will increase annual profits by $1.3 billion in 2002 dollars (2002$) or 4 percent. This estimate is robust to numerous specification checks and relatively precise, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. We also find the hedonic approach—which is the standard in the previous literature—to be unreliable because it produces estimates that are extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices about control variables, sample, and weighting.
